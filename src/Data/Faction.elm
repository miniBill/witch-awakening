        """Registering for college at Arcadia is free to any witch and comes with room and board in one of the dorms. Schedules are self determined with classes you can drop in and out of, and attendance works in time slots throughout the day, not a specific hour. If you miss 10AM, rain check for 2PM, or 10PM. There are classes for any specialization you have access to where you’ll be taught foundational principles and functions for your rank. There are classes for other specializations that exist but weren’t in the cards for your awakening (I can’t write every potentiality after all, third party extensions are encouraged!), which you can sit in for without credit if you want. Non-magic classes also exist; Such as planar theory, cryptozoology, esoteric chemistry, antediluvian mathematics, and more. There’s a very casual atmosphere letting witches move at their own pace. You DO have attendance, but it’s in totality at a the end of a cycle (3 month period). If you miss the day a class is taught, it can be made up within the cycle and no grades are set in stone until the cycle changes. Classes aside, you can expect an overabundance of entertainment and leisure options. Naturally, the arcade is a favorite destination within the town, and the entire town is routed through to the material world with Hex VPN, but by default they rely on their own local network first.

        Teachers are very fond of practical exams, applied learning, and field trips. APG atmosphere exists, but more adult activities are permitted if not publicly displayed, like the old red curtain back rooms of old movie stores, for example. Order is managed by a very capable police-military that double as basic problem solvers and community service. They’re the ones that get the cat out of the tree and organize service and charities. They can afford to be spread out since crime is so low and they default to warnings, not cuffs. That said, Arcadia at large is not actually a democracy but more comparable to private property of the eccentric witch that started it all within her own pocketspace from Witchery. After founding Arcadia and establishing its laws, she left it to coast from there without a recognizable government to make up new laws. She hasn’t been seen since, as far as we know."""
    , location =
        """Arcadia is particularly known for, well, Arcadia, the town itself. It’s a beautiful scenic town of a few thousand people, a third of them currently active students with the rest staff and alumni or otherwise residents operating various shops and services. Commerce is a little unusual to mortals in that it’s a service-barter economy operating on trading goods or favors. Think of it like a quest. If you want the Potion Maker’s potion of hair-b-gone, maybe you’ll need to do a fetch quest for them first. Usually such requests relate to acquiring the ingredients they need to make it plus a bit of compensation for their own time and effort in the production. Gold is used sporadically as a valued trade medium not necessarily as a currency, but as a raw trade good used in a number of rituals and crafts.

        The entire town is made with walking or broomsticks in mind, as such there aren’t many actual roads except as far as they’re just wider paths that expect more people, or to leave a more open space with good sightlines of the town and it surrounding woody mountainside to the north, rolling hills to the northwest, rocky cliffs to the northeast, sandy beaches to the east, grassy plains to the west, rivers and woods to the southwest, south, and southeast. The exact particulars change with every Cycle, the landscape beyond the town limits dissolving into dream mist and reshaped based on the student board’s vote, including impossible geology. The landscape is designed by a collaboration between planar theory classes with physical education clubs to design good features optimal for extracurricular activities. Hiking, swimming, spelunking, rock climbing, mountain biking, even road tips. The town does have some main roads, and an outer ring that can connect to roads that get generated in the cycle to lead up to various points of civilization. It’s seen as rustic and old school to use an automobile in place of a broom, for the experience of it. Enchanted, of course, operating on any number of forms of magical intervention to not require gas or produce emissions.

        Cycle generation works a lot like programming a random generator for an open world, relying on base logic and assets it pulls from to then scale out infinitely, as well as incorporating custom locations designed with more precise care and consideration, either placed in fixed locations from the town or as another part of generation to sprinkle throughout, and can then string roads to certain types of locations including temporary towns or whole cities generated for that cycle. The zombie theme a few cycles back was a favorite."""

Combined the Health courses ensure residents can coexist in Hawthorne and manage discourse. These courses include describing your opinion of your peers, and why, and if you have any suspicions about them that are a danger to the health of other students, themselves, or the Academy. Rules are plentiful and judiciously enforced alongside their own Common Law, being their own nation state. Capital punishment exists, though only for severe violent actions or gross malevolence, and exile for irreconcilable differences is otherwise the Final extreme, otherwise Hawthorne employs a wide array of disciplinarian tactics above and beyond what mortals would consider ethical. Generally discipline is specific to different houses, as houses in part represent personality characteristics, different discipline methods are more or less effective in the different houses. If one house is failing to discipline appropriate, re-evaluations occur and you can be reassigned to a house with different discipline methods. Houses likewise have their own uniforms though they all are approved by the Oversight Board to share certain qualities and colors, generally a degree of formality. The goal? Hawthorne may seem totalitarian, but their purpose is genuineThe excellence of their students, by any means necessary.

The cavern is big, but it’s disproportionately warped as to currently be around the size of Germany, completely filled with a sprawling metropolis.

The Watchers get their name from their stance as a third party observing the events playing out at the hands of human faith -- And strange celestial beings as real as Witches already know Demons to be. Through these observations they’ve studied the influences and nature of the divine, and are generally convinced of an overarching theory connecting the Abrahamic traditions, and have come to the conclusion that there _*is*_ a coming apocalypse. Watchers are embedded in religious institutions where they keep their finger on the pulse and catalogue and investigate reports of divine influence and visionary experiences, finding that all religions experience them to different degrees. While some religions revolve around ancient witches and extraplanar entities, Abrahamic faiths interact with a category of beings referred to as Celestials. Watchers learned methods to emulate these beings through magic. They classify them as Pre-Mortal Celestials and Post-Mortal Celestials. Premortals are like living chariots of rings, eyes, and wings, and are spiritual constructs while Post-Mortals fare humanoid shaped entities with physical forms that can interact with the material world if they chose but bare elements of their prior construct form, rings becoming halos in various designs for example, and may have more extreme body shapes and proportions.

        As a watcher, your purpose is to keep tabs on religions and report on interesting events within your jurisdiction. Other Watcher agents may be approached to dedicate themselves to other roles, such as becoming a politician for an area of interest, or more often and historically available; Wife to a powerful figure, not just for the sake of gender roles, they have women in key places as well, but the logistics and avoiding spotlights, as well as playing nicer with the treaties against direct involvement. Another reason they typically advocate for democracies; They can hold positions of power while claiming the will of humans as opposed to their own intentions. So long as they convince the population to vote the way they’d prefer. Which they’ve gotten very skilled at doing, with no direct use of magic involved. Where Hespatia is cloak and dagger, Watchers hide in plain sight and are more likely to be involved with something like corporate espionage, though most Watchers do just that. Observe. Agents themselves may not know what their purpose is, just what they need to do without context of how it fits into a greater picture. The higher up the food chain you go the more of the puzzle you’ll see, but even at the top they skate along on complex interfaith theories and mysticism, not fully comprehending the forces they’re trying to dance along the periphery of, balancing ancient treaties, mortal interests, and not stepping on celestial toes.

Instead of a fly, you’d see a tiny six-legged kitten you could hold handfuls of at once. Some islands are claimed where witches have retired to, otherwise the Watchers operate their HQ here on one large island where they have a large palatial castle of white marble and gold. New certified witches are brought to Eden where they go through initiation. Some initiated witches manifest False Light, gaining a halo and wings.

They revel in and are the principle origins of all the classic witch tropes as well as cult tropes. From dancing nude around a bonfire under the light of a lunar eclipse, to ritual sacrifices by hooded figures around an altar. The coven is compartmentalized into local families that operate in similar manners but with different focuses and individual practices. They share an overarching framework known by the heads of families where most members don’t know the full scope, only knowing the family name for their local group. This means when one grows too large and destabilizes or gets infiltrated or exposed, only that family burns. Some families readily engage with ritual sacrifice and blood rites, while other families choose to abstain, it doesn’t matter to Hespatia at large, and agents acting for the overall coven are called Specters and Wraiths, who take a family’s specializations in consideration when delivering orders from the Crowns, the central coven acting as a council of seers that pull the strings. Families can include mundane humans, in fact, it’s key to how they operate. It helps establish mortal connections, and establish networks for trafficking and finding willing or unwilling subjects of their rituals. For some things you’d get more out of, or outright need, an unwilling subject, for others a willing subject devoted to the purpose.

        When Hespatians are being referred to, it generally refers to the inter-family network, not local families, the Specters, Wraiths, and Crowns. Specters are general agents, information runners, and problem solvers that manage spies and communications. Wraiths are assassins, thieves, and abductors that act on Specter information on contract requests or Crown edicts on something they need done. A Specter can expect to be meeting informants, inspecting families, vetting members, and default to living a life in a role among mortals where you can keep tabs on important figures or adjacent to family members in a position of power where you keep tabs. You might also engineer blackmail opportunities, both for families and influential figures. A Wraith can expect to receive lack letters with names and places indicating assassination targets. Red letters describe an object and location. White letters indicate a capture target and delivery location Letters burn into existence, then crumble to ash when read. Or a Specter may relay jobs involving asset protection, or infiltrations above a specter’s pay grade that are expected to involve a fight. Specters or Wraiths can go up the food chain within their own ranks, and if they possess the right skills and magical potential, can become Crowns within the central coven eventually, the oldest Crowns are at best guess, antediluvian.

But a core to their operations is their usage of hell itself. Most families with an established center of operations include a hellgate somewhere within, likely unknown or shrugged off as superstition to most the family members themselves.

        These all connect to Hespatia’s headquarters in a layer of hell bordering the abyss full of dense jungle littered with volcanos, and oversaturated with hyperpredators and every life form is out to cause death and suffering, from the syringe-like blades of grass to the palm leaves covered in poisonous microbarbs that shed and are a real treat to inhale, to variations of infernal dinosaurs. Turns out the dinosaurs went to hell, who would have thought. The headquarters is on a smaller island off the mainland, and surrounded by a crescent mountainrange blocking it from the ocean... a natural barrier against creatures of the deep, as the infinite abyss begins its exponential drop off that never ends. Sometimes a sunrise is the luminous bulb of a leviathan... The walls are made of organic near-living shapes. Some mortals who have seen it are left scarred in the psyche and paint things they’ve witnessed, along with other things they see later on as a part of their mind gets caught in the rifts to wander the layers of hell and the abyss, and are often compelled to draw, paint, or write what they’ve seen.

Other Founding witches act like a Supreme Court in vetting the King’s actions against the Iron Tablets. There are strong rights centered around the individual, with consequences to masters that mistreat slaves. Who are themselves slaves to someone higher up the food chain. Similar to having a boss who has a boss, who has a boss. And lastly, there are no taxes. Instead, the hierarchies act as a division of labor for upkeep and maintenance of lunabella, and there’s a culture of taking pride in that upkeep and in the wellbeing of slaves under your care. Despite being slaves, social mobility is good as you earn promotions or someone gets demoted. A lack of scarcity means everyone can be provided for and there are constant feasts and events being planned and implemented at every social rung in the ladder and everyone can expect a lot of free time.

        There are undefined concepts of imposition and command that act as a balancing act between the extent that a master can will on a slave and a sphere of influence that contains the master’s authority to their domain. A master over a house can command a slave for the benefit of the house, but not for her own interests beyond the house, such as her own entertainment in isolation. While out of that domain, the master holds no unnatural authority over them, they’re both then in the same position as slaves to the master of that domain they both fall under. Doing harm to the slave of another is a property crime. If that master doesn’t care, it goes up the food chain until the King himself is offended on their behalf, instituting a barrier of security for the protection of individual rights. This includes protection against sexual abuse, though individuals can choose to sign away that right to specific individuals, backed by a strong Bureaucracy of only the necessary legal frameworks as a support structure for individuals and the society, rather than the bureaucracy being a hammer against the individual as seen by most civilizations.

        Life in Lunabella is extremely relaxed and a paradisaical place, some might have more responsibility than others, but as a new citizen you can auction yourself to masters for a form of bidding, where you can then choose an offer to accept after investigating each, even talking to their other slaves, masters encourage it; After all, remember that status is associated with the well being of one’s slaves, so them sharing their opinions is equivalent to someone wealthy showing off jewels and finery. If a master is disagreeable, you can petition someone a step up the ladder to reassign you or to renounce citizenship to step out from the hierarchy entirely and try again or move elsewhere. Visitors are welcome and treated as guests, but you can outstay your welcome and lingering too long begins to be seen as parasitical and taking advantage of your host, guests are expected to have a level of graciousness themselves.

The Twin Courts, Summer and Winter, are the primary political agents of the realm and most life is associated with one or the other, or interacts with both to play at neutrality at the expense of political weight. The Summer Court sometimes referred to as the Seelie Court, is a regal but rigid coalition of regions and powers that embody Law and Order. Their court is full of ritual, ceremony, rules, and propriety. If you know their labyrinthine rules and customs, you can be confident that you know what you can or can’t do. In theory. Their rules can seem esoteric and strange, while the authority of one’s Lord or Lady over whoever is lower in status is strictly adhered to- Within lawful boundaries. They’re more bureaucratic than their counterpart, with many nobles and courtiers being akin to accountants and lawyers that dress fancy.

        The Winter or Unseelie Court on the other hand, would represent chaos. Where Summer craves authority, Winter craves liberty. Winter politics are far more unpredictable. They retain a hierarchy of authority figures, but their influence is more _diplomatic_, a matter of mutual exchange and favors. They keep government influence minimal with reduced central authority and increased local authority, so no two cities or regions of the Winter court are too similar to another, as they largely each make up their own rules. This can lead to many abuses and some consider them to be the “bad guys” for their hands-off approach, but the unseelie are just as free to depose of any would-be tyrants or corrupt lords. They recognize the authority of such a ruler, but if deposed, then the authority of the usurpers are just as valid once the dust settles, and in general you tend to find more of the outcasts and shady types flocking to Winter territories simply by nature of such figures pushed out of the more orderly Summer territories, a question of cause or effect. Nonetheless, the Twin Courts are still two faces of the Alliance as a whole, and they cooperate and have some shared values and interests as neighbors, like bickering siblings they can seem to be at each other’s throats but support each other in hardships.

        If you were to join the Summer court you could expect a life of kings, queens, princes, and princesses. Castles, and knights sworn to various oaths and codes, a high culture fantasy where bands of adventurers or knights set off on quests for honor, duty, and justice. On the other hand, if you were to join the Winter court you could expect a life of lords, regents and merchant-princes embroiled in conspiracy and scheme with a mix of political machinations or cloak and dagger, where adventurers and sellswords for hire quest for wealth and glory. Knights or agents of the Winter Court may operate covertly throughout their realms keeping tabs on the lands to watch for particularly bad actors that go too far and act to destabilize or support and even lead opposition, whether it’s a cruel tyrant that came to power, or some noble that grew too big for their pants and thinks to undermine the Court."""

        """If you thought the Hespatians were villainous, Outsiders make them look like antiheroes. The things that some Hespatians merely dabble in, Outsiders actively revel in. Outsiders aren’t simply amoral, but they are actively profane and explicitly evil, no gray area, no nuance, they simply are evil, because sometimes evil people exist, and if they don’t end up in Hespatia, the Outsiders probably found them. They do things that I cannot in good conscience repeat or even suggest, the least of all are the simple expected evils that require high levels of corruption just to conceptualize, and hearing about them can cause high cognito damage to innocent minds -- so imagine the glee of an Outsider in _performing_ such actions on or with the innocent. The library that the ORC mentioned that “made demons weep”, was containing a forbidden archive of captured Outsider texts deep in its vaults after a narrow vote by the council of New Alexandria to elect not to destroy them, and the ORC took it upon themselves. I’m still pissed, but it’s understandable. Infohazards are nothing to scoff at and can bypass warding runes, as it’s not a magical effect, but a part of life, requiring psychosurgery to attempt to mend.

        Outsiders live to bring maximum suffering and corruption to weaken the memetic consciousness that stabilizes the local Aether, allowing intrusions from the Far Gods, entities from beyond the aether, which is the scope of this self contained reality. Far Gods are as varied and different as local deities are, but are overwhelmingly alien entities that bend the mind to perceive. Average humans instantly go mad when any of the 5 senses attempt to perceive one, and slowly go mad with exposure to any related entity or phenomenon. Strong willed humans might go only mostly insane. Witches and Mediums can endure for longer, enough that repeated brief exposure can build up a tolerance while maintaining most of your sanity, but that sanity can be overwhelmed with too much exposure at once. They would have to overwhelmingly corrupt tens of millions of people at once to allow a Far God to actually breach our reality, but any horror can operate on a sliding scale to allow lesser abominations to slither through the cracks in the fabric, and further atrocities are committed to keep the abominations they summoned happy or well fed. They don’t care about the masquerade, but are nonetheless forced to adhere to it or they’d be fish in a barrel for every other faction who would have open license to purge them with the full threat of divine retribution."""

They can likewise crop up in other places with other factions to varying extents. For example, Alphazon can be daring enough to experiment with profane Outsider texts and artifacts, which invariably results in containment breaches, but the information gleaned is deemed worthwhile, while the ORC learned long ago that it’s better to destroy on sight, often using nuclear tests as cover. Lunabella had a breach in one of their isolated domains land the entire sphere was condemned for _Deus Nihilo_, resulting in a new lunar crater on the dark side of the moon. Hawthorne has had multiple small breeches but their capable staff and surveillance has intervened before they got out of hand beyond a building or two. Arcadia as far as we know, has not had an Outsider incursion.

        Otherwise, the disparate pantheon of Far Gods provides a large number of potentially accessible dimensions and parasitic Realms manifesting within this Aether, each harmonized with a specific Far God or two, from mutagenic fleshscapes, labyrinths of bone, inorganic technophage constructs, and mind numbing geometric paradoxes. Portals and unnatural rifts to such locations actively spread the relevant corruption throughout the surrounding area, twisting the terrain, the flora, and the fauna into the image of the Far God in question. An Outsider with Dominion could have their whole bubble act as a direct reflection of this nature, including their combat bubbles being an immediate nightmare of a twisted reflection of the reality it overlays, and the same goes for their Pocketspace from witchery and their Mothergifts, which might be a living parasite suit or armor, a technophage patron Far God might make their Mothergifts manifest as a techno-organic construct something between armor and a second skin, any of which allows natural protections from the respective environment. And, of course, open Portals to a relevant Far Realm, which can be almost as dangerous to them as to an enemy in pursuit."""

        """The O.R.C. was established around 1767 from the remnants of old world anti-magic orders that didn’t survive in the new world as it was growing, they gained a bad reputation for events such as the Salem Witch Trials of the previous century. Originally called the Iron Brotherhood, it was redefined into the Occult Research and Containment around the 1900s, and really took off around 1939-1960 as World War II threatened to break the Masquerade with occult research skyrocketing with efforts by the National Socialist Party of Germany. The ORC was a leading role in combating occult threats, and in the aftermath of the war absorbed the German scientists and facilities. The Tsar Bomba incident was a joint operation with the Soviets, who’ve since joined ORC International. There were almost as many German ORC as there were Americans at the time, so it had an impact on the internal culture. If they could accept the Germans and Communists, they could accept others; Witches. Skip to the present day and the ORC is a cooperation of humans and witches heavily investing in the exploration of occult matters, magic, with machinery. They can appear to have stagnated, but their old fashioned appearances hide complex connections and artifacts used to achieve things beyond what technology alone can achieve... And besides, the 1950s look works for us. Initial designs for fabrication tools and development enchantments have locked in on the aesthetic and it’d be an unnecessary hassle to change it. We’re a government operation and have long standing institutional inroads with the military that have allowed us to prevent those Watchers or Hespatians from getting a foothold within it and when operating in the Real we work off the military for a strong global presence and mundane assets. Just don’t remind them that ORC International tends to have the same sort of military connections in the militaries of many other countries much like the smarmy suits at Alphazon are gaining international influence within business as the first unaccountable Megacorp.

        At the ORC you can find pencil pushers of all sorts, scientists of every field, and many laboratories studying magic anomalies, artifacts, and witches themselves. As a witch, you’d be in the same boat as me. We’re field agents. Witches tend to be less fragile than mortals, the name sticks for a reason, and we’re treated in the ballpark of being a living weapon -- with feelings. Lucky for us the ORC carries old school opinions on their American roots such as the 2A and a person being their own weapon isn’t such an issue. Every ORC member is strapped with tools to help level the playing field if one of us decides to become a problem, and tensions have died down, it’s now normalized and we’re as much a part of the team as the humans, and our field capabilities are respected.

        You can expect to do many things from keeping tabs on non-ORC witches, look for newly awakened witches to get onto our side, hunt dangerous beings, monsters, anomalies, and artifacts for containment, and don’t forget to file reports and check in for full-spectrum arcanoscopies to check your health and potential curses or damage to your very existence from mishandling an ancient... or _alien_ artifact, Outsider problems tend to stain more than just your nice dress. The ones we don’t, or can’t, destroy are kept in secure ORC Vault Facilities that are kept under constant guard of a mix of personnel and the handful of contracted spirits that have a good vested interest keeping something locked down tight typically due to the threat aligning with something important to the entity, others just like the attention they receive, getting a taste of the good old days when powerful spirits were worshiped. The Masquerade put a damper on those things, in most cases."""

This secret megacorp is the king of tech as a monopoly over just about every piece of hardware or software you’ve seen in civilized markets, Western and Chinese. It wasn’t long before they started having questions, and finding the answers for themselves, and figuring out that politics weren’t just a game about money changing hands or the right bribes, but uncovered the influence of paranormal entities and witches. They began running their own private blacksites as part of their investigations, abducting people they algorithmically detected as probable witches, followed by direct surveillance to catch them in an act. While the Orcs have their head in the clouds chasing fairy tales and saving the world, Alphazon was rising to power within the public domain, among humans, with a board of directors beginning to view themselves as gods greater than any single country and with no allegiance or nationality save for themselves. They rapidly diverted resources into occult research with modern machinery and supercomputing, able to do in a few years what took decades for the ORC back in the day.

        Alphazon is brutal and has transcended mere profit for the pursuit of actual power and secrets beyond their mortal limitations. Cocky and two-faced, if you thought politician speak was bad, there’s nothing more belittling, insulting, and disingenuous than corporate speak. At least we at the ORC stand for something and have an identity, and try to operate within shared values. Actual shared values, not some PR pitch. They’ll invade every aspect of your life and privacy, any device a bug of its own to listen in, even send actors to interact with you and pry information and sus out your potential and cooperativeness and run a risk assessment. Too high, you’ll never be seen again. Moderately high, you’ll wake up in a cage as they soften you up and try literal brainwashing techniques. Just right and they’ll directly talk about recruitment. Too low and you might not be worth the effort. As an agent for Alphazon you’d be implanted with trackers and full passive surveillance of your biology and recording what you perceive, and put somewhere optimized for your skill set from making potions to running spy work, or hit jobs to knock off problem witches and humans alike or convincing new tech firms to sell or drop lawsuits, and you’d have access to using these mass surveillance systems for your own benefit as you please. Alphazon has almost as much government and alphabet soup agencies as the ORC does, who increasingly rely on Alphazon tech originally to try to game the system since it’s not technically government surveillance now is it? It’s a private company, they can do what they want. And they do. Depends on the person I guess, some might enjoy working for them. It has its perks, and some don’t mind a lack of privacy, I may be biased, I joined the ORC after being bagged myself.

        Word on the wire from the Lunabellans is that Alphazon has set up a research base on Mars employing several known Hespatians, just one of many, it’s hard to keep up with and those are just the ones we know of when they’re admittedly much better at this game than we are. From experimental vaults raising people in isolation under different testing parameters, to large puzzle ridden facilities because they can. Many of their facilities can be classified as Anomalies themselves, and are responsible for a significant uptick in anomalous activity when their projects get out of hand for the ORC to clean up. They disavow, of course. We’ve also heard rumors of advanced stealth technologies and the phrase “Godsight Arrays”. I don’t like the sound of that.
