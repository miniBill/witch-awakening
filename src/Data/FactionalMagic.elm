With more attention, emotion, and repeat application of will, some ideas get rooted and cemented in that abyss, adding to the infinite expanse of the Something, the opposing sphere of influence encompassing all that is. To cut the preamble short: Digicasting is the access to worlds of imagination created over time from dedicated dreamers. The dream of an author giving birth to a new world line by line over years of dwelling on it. The shared imagination of countless developers, as well as players, that share in the experience of a digitally realized reality. Some forms of this magic have existed in isolated cases focused on dreams, Digicasting is a new specialization formalized in Arcadia and taught alongside planar theory."""

Unlike a lucid dream, the dream is not in your control but is running on automatic from the collective intentions of its contributors behind that world’s creation.

You can observe IPs and search, or seek out a known IP. Computers connected to Hex VPN stand out to you with strange identifiers that are unique but unreadable by devices, visible only to witches in digicast.

You’re solid all the way through with desired exceptions. The form can be 2D or 3D. In this form, you can enter and exit screens or illustrations freely. When you exit you can assume normal size, or exit at the scale of the screen. A phone screen could see you at a few inches tall. A large theater screen could easily octuple your height, Or large wall art on the size of a building. If 2D, your edges are blade-like and you can slip through cracks wide and uniform enough to slip through, allowing for only slight bends as though made of stiff rubber, but you can also reduce the profile of your 2D form by crouching, for example.

Extensions have the same cost as a centerpiece and have the laws written on them as well. Again, this doesn’t influence those who were already in an area when it was established.

        This is where the faewilds really get their reputation of archaic rules and customs and why many fae have a reputation for particular social dangers, not just because of natural social consequences: of unintentional offense, but because you may not know if there are any strange laws you may be subject to, and you have to be very cautious and cunning to notice if someone has established a verbal contract you may accidentally agree to.
