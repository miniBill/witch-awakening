## Quest: Adventure Time
- Slot: Folk
- Threat: 1
- Conflict: 1
- Reward: 1

What are the chances. One moment you’re at home or some equivalent, perfectly content sipping your favorite drink and in a sudden instance of abrupt chaos you’re thrown like a car crash and twisted through a Wild Rift to some unknown land where three moons streak across the sky illuminated by binary stars.

There is no sign of civilization, just rich nature and crisp air.

As for life, it appears that predation was never evolved in this world, neither are there harmful bacteria, parasites, fungus, or viruses. All creatures found in this place are friendly with complex social evolution and methods of nonverbal communication

Notes:
+ A very safe world with no natural threats other than accidents.
+ All life appears to actively try to help other lifeforms, even the plants will bend to shelter you from the rain, vines may creep up to stem your bleeding, fluffy critters will bring you help.
+ You’ll find a way out after 3y, unless you have Portals.


## Quest: Special Delivery
- Slot: Folk
- Threat: 1
- Conflict: 1
- Reward: 1

You’ve received a job by some means, where you’re given a shipment of deliveries that need to be made before the big night on Halloween, delivering packages and parcels of items that are important to the would-be recipients. Perhaps even the good Stork got one of his bundles mixed up into your delivery basket. Otherwise all the items are low tier magical items with strange enchantments that are not beneficial to combat in any way, mostly being novelties related to Halloween from candy snakes to mood setting jack-o-lanterns or candles, and abnormal candies with exotic flavors special to the supernatural world of Witchdom.

Notes:
+ Pays your body weight in fantastical mystery candies.
+ Each delivery target may be a fun eccentric character to interact with, and may have good tips or become useful contacts.
+ In your reward is an oddly shaped and worded invitation to Halloween Town.


## Quest: Sightseeing
- Slot: Folk
- Threat: 1
- Conflict: 1
- Reward: 1

You’re new in town, likely fresh off of your witch awakening and now being shown the ropes in the area your primary faction sets up shop, or perhaps you’re just taking a tourist stop at some other new location on or off earth. After all, you can probably now go anywhere you want on Earth now with little effort through the gates of other witches’ established travel networks, an ally that can take you somewhere, or just venturing off on your own by broomstick or ride. Whatever the case, you have some time to kill absorbing the sights of the world with new eyes, and maybe you’ll meet some friends along the way.

Notes:
+ Not inherently dangerous, but by your own choices you might run into trouble, from visiting shady back alley streets or getting caught up in the affairs of a supernatural entity.
+ You can explore on your own of course, but this quest guarantees the opportunity for up to 2/y in total.


## Quest: Dream Trial
- Slot: Folk
- Threat: 2
- Conflict: 3
- Reward: 1

At some point you’ll catch the attention of someone or something that takes an interest in you, benevolent or malevolent, but nonetheless somewhat intrusive -- They’ll render you unconscious via a spiritual or physical means of inducing sleep. Whatever they wanted with you, you’ll experience an exotic surreal dream wherein you will confront a series of trials or one greater trial, trials that reveal various character flaws about yourself. Things you on some level know could be better, or that you shouldn’t do, or secret desires you avoid facing. The perpetrator may or may not be involved with the dream, or it may be a side effect of something else.

Notes:
+ Whatever the perpetrators intentions, this quest is guaranteed to cause no lasting harm or endanger your life. Whatever they wanted would be satisfied or interrupted without escalation unless you chain this quest into a more serious quest.
+ The trials can help overcome mental hangups.


## Quest: Pinch of Stardust
- Slot: Folk
- Threat: 1
- Conflict: 1
- Reward: 1

You’ve come into possession of an interesting recipe book of alchemical cooking, giving recipes for various potions in food forms. One recipe in particular catches your eye that appears to describe a process by which to distill starlight into usable stardust.

Naturally the only reasonable course of action is to go attempt to follow the recipe by going out before dawn and focusing starlight into one point, and then letting the rays of the rising sun crystalize the captive rays into twinkling grains of stardust.

It might take a few nights, you only get one shot every morning to attempt it, but seeing the handful of stardust will be satisfying.

Notes:
+ Stardust is beautiful, like powdered gemstones that always sparkle just right.
+ Stardust can be used as an alchemical ingredient sufficient for potions up to rank 3, or a minor ingredient in others.
+ Can be converted into 50 Kisses or sold for 1-200.

### Sidebar
To be clear, starlight refining is now a skill you can make use of any morning you wish.


## Quest: Introductions
- Slot: Folk
- Evil Route: True
- Threat: 1
- Conflict: 1
- Reward: 1

it’s only natural for a new witch to attract the attention of other witches in the area. Wherever you end up settling down for some length of time or visit an area after having made some name for yourself already, you’ll receive an invite or by chance get include in on a meeting between a handful of regional witches either to just have a conversation to get a feel for you, to introduce themselves, or perhaps it was for some minor event they already had planned anyway and will bring you in on. Perhaps this is where you’ll meet one or more of your future Companions, or maybe you’ll never see these people again after a potentially rambunctious night.

Notes:
+ If used towards companions, the Reward for this quest amounts 4RP instead of 1. If you use this opportunity on a free companion instead, you can raise their Sociability or Teamwork +1
+ What the gathering entails is up to you so long as it makes sense for those involved, and the low threat /conflict.

- Evil Route: True
- Threat: 1
- Conflict: 1
- Reward: 1

You, alone or with friends, decided it was a great idea to spend a particular rainy night listening to, telling, or watching spooky stories. As you part ways for the night to go off to your own rooms or your own homes, or otherwise wind down for the night, everyone finds themselves on edge with goosebumps and thoughts of the stories shared or movies watched earlier that night. The night will be beset by a host of spooky phenomenon made more spooky by your understanding as a witch that things like ghosts and other monsters ARE in fact, very real and you might see one now where you wouldn’t have been able to before!

Notes:
+ No matter how terrifying it can get, no harm will come to anyone.
+ How the spooks occur is entirely up to you, perhaps there really is a monster under the bed! Perhaps a poltergeist watched the movie with you and decided to pull pranks, or just one of the friends did. Perhaps it was all mundane tricks?

### Sidebar
Perhaps YOU are the one pranking others! Your companions or associates might have words for you later though.


## Quest: Laundry Day
- Slot: Folk
- Evil Route: True
- Threat: 1
- Conflict: 1
- Reward: 1

Well then. That stain isn’t coming off any time soon You somehow ran afoul of a gang of gremlins and leprechauns, who pulled a prank(s) on you that culminated in every article of clothing you own, including your own witch garments no less, stained with a curse of distress leading to any number of potential mishaps where they end up stained torn or outright disappearing right off your back The curse requires a specialist you’re referred to who runs a laundromat for mortals and witches a like with a special Kiss coin slot normally hidden by the veil that activates the curse cleansing cycle, with that fresh newly blessed scent.

Notes:
+ You might think of other means to remove curses, but whatever the scenario this will end up the most practical option easy at hand.
+ Side quest: Leprechauns are lecherous bastards and may have taken inappropriate photos of you or others you become aware and have to track down for an extra 2rp

### Sidebar
Maybe you instead cut a deal with the leprechaun and instead sell more pictures as the means to get that 2 extra rp, etc.


## Quest: Discount Goods
- Slot: Folk
- Threat: 2
- Conflict: 2
- Reward: 1

On the lookout for a place to buy some goods, you find a bit of a run down establishment with a veiled sign out front displaying a different message for witches, and an internal domain means you enter a separate space than what a human would. The witch running the store is having some money troubles and needs to push sales quick, so she’s offering everything at half off and may add in a favor or two in the process. You can use this shop this one time to buy any Ingredients, Potions, Runes, or Relics priced at less than 6p, all at half price up to a total discount of no more than 25,000 Kiss equivalent, or no more than 3rp off a relic. Can do both K and rp.

Notes:
+ Note that potion sales are typically 50-200% more expensive than the listed base price shown in the magics, as that’s the creation cost.
+ She possesses Ritual Inks, and can use them to tattoo you with runes without buying the Ritual Ink relic yourself.
+ Good candidate for a Custom companion?

## Quest: Free Medical
- Slot: Folk
- Threat: 1
- Conflict: 2
- Reward: 1

This quest is a little bit of job security. At some point in the future you’ll be severely injured as the result of something, likely some higher ranked quest, but this quest ensures you’ll have an encounter where your medical needs will be provided for you free of charge, perhaps with an associated service or favor that might chain to another quest later, or perhaps they simply have ulterior motives. For example: This could be the classic scenario where someone is defeated only to be rescued by a stranger and then treated in a strange environment or safehouse, tended to until back in shape enough to go challenge the boss or monster again.

Notes:
+ This can also be used as a one time life saver to ensure that though you’ll lose, you’ll survive one encounter that may have killed you (And not have to risk cheating death, or Free Medical ensures your means of cheating death works and is taken, of, like making sure your Draviri egg hatches, ect.)

### Sidebar
Interaction: You can use this to claim the rewards of a quest early, and use this recovery period as the opportunity to spend it, and return with advantage


## Quest: The Swimsuit Episode

- Evil Route: True
- Threat: 2
- Conflict: 1
- Reward: 1

Anyone can just go to the beach or the pool, but with this quest you’re ensured for an extra special trip to some manner of swimsuit event, or you could integrate this quest with another to transform that quest into a swimsuit episode by some means, where events are orchestrated such that the other quest occurs with everyone still in their swimsuits. Taken on its own however, it means it won’t just be a normal day in the water but will incorporate any and all the tropes you think make up the ideal swimsuit episode in how it affects others as well as yourself, in light hearted ways. Functionally distinct from “Hot Springs” as hot springs focus on relaxing.

Notes:
+ Everyone involved will permanently gain their ideal swimsuit as a form their Garment can take when summoned.
+ Can take you to any water park or beach location you can think of, provided there are no lasting supernatural benefits.
+ You control the ESRB rating, so to speak.

- Slot: Folk
- Evil Route: True
- Threat: 2
- Conflict: 2
- Reward: 1

By some means you’ll be invited to a particular tea party, a private affair or a part of a larger event. It could be serious, like a precursor to Courtship, Just Desserts, or meeting the mark of On My Mark, or perhaps it’s just a light hearted novelty and moment of reprieve. The tea party is one that makes good use of the fact that the attendants are witches. Every dish will in some way be magical, though only the main course will have lasting effects that extend beyond the next morning. The Main Course will be a single use consumable that you eat or drink there at the party that can carry the benefits of any one Potion from Alchemy.

Notes:
+ This includes rank 5 potions. Drink or consume an Arch-Curative in the form of a cake that fully rejuvenates your body, grant you agelessness if you lacked it, or perhaps you were roofied with a Love Potion? Did a True-shape potion replace your race with that of another? Wake up a Mimi? A Doll?

## Quest: Moonlit Serenade
- Slot: Noble
- Threat: 3
- Conflict: 4
- Reward: 3

A fated chance encounter or a moment that makes you and one other see each other in a new light, and you will feel the spark of love, mutual, leading to a romantic night. How far exactly that goes is up to your discretion, but it won’t be a casual choice not to pursue it further as you will feel actual love and a connection, so make sure there’s some actual reason why the relationship won’t advance further, if you intend to try to keep it to a one-night stand. It won’t be all fun and games, there may be some minor quarreling with past rivals, exes, or some the event experiences an interruption at some point at any spot in the timeline, perhaps it’s how you meet.

Notes:
+ This can target a companion that can reasonably be attracted to you. Sexuality is usually glossed over, so mostly free reign.
+ Can pair well with Courtship to ensure a meeting goes well, if you’re one of the parties involved in the proposition.
+ Grants 3 more RP if it leads into Domesticated.

## Quest: Yes Teacher!
- Slot: Noble
- Threat: 4
- Conflict: 5

Notes:
+ You can select the teacher for any options that would allow you to select a friend, and choose a second School Trip.

Perhaps one was lost in the cargo of a sunken ship.

Notes:
+ If you write at least a sentence in your build for each book’s own particular predicament, you can gain an extra 3rp.

- Conflict: 4
- Reward: 4

Requires Lunabella, Alphazon, ORC, HexVPN, OR Battleship. In short, some means to receive space comms personally or as a mission from a higher up who received it. At some point in time sensors, tech or magical, pick up on an unknown object streaking through the solar system from beyond the oort cloud heading through on a trajectory straight to the sun. A Ghost or HexNet (or both) broadcast is repeating a distress signal on repeat requesting help in a quickly deciphered strange language spoken in a feminine voice To the point, a space ship is on collision course with the sun and being pursued by a space kraken, naturally you’ll need to step in.

- Threat: 5
- Conflict: 4
- Reward: 6

For whatever reason, business or interests have taken you to Alfheimr, the faewild. While there you run into a chance encounter with an abnormally fluffy corgi-inu that tries to get your attention with a particular spark of intellect in its eyes. Occasionally growling in the direction it tries to lead you before returning to being adorable. It will lead you through a series of minor trials, nothing for a witch such as yourself, and end with an encounter with a large beast. In the vicinity of the beast you’ll find the dead body of a witch of a type that has a death cheat that requires a bit of care to make sure it works successfully, such as a draviri egg.

Notes:
+ The corgi-inu is familiar to the dead witch.
+ Once the dust settles, the corgi-inu whines next to their witch’s remains or the cheat death focal item, and stares at you with huge begging eyes. The corgi-inu will slowly vanish over time, or instantly if the cheat death object is destroyed.

### Sidebar
there’s an obvious bad route where you do not save the dead witch, leaving the corgi-inu to fade, or destroying the witch’s means of cheating death or making it implausible, in which case the corgi-inu dies. Or a worse path may involve abducting the vulnerable witch.

Those in the know have been watching the direction Sara came from, and it just paid off as we’ve noticed a fleet of entities entering the system from the same spot as Sara & her space tentacle friends.

Go outside of a Domain bubble if you want to view the sky without any atmosphere in the way. Maybe it’s a romantic idea to try to get closer to one of your companions and you’ll enjoy some candle light with your picnic basket somewhere in the Sea of Tranquility or maybe you just want to soak in the silence of the airless landscape beyond the domains. Bringing back a moon rock is fine too.

So, the ORC has issued a request for available agents and general staff to volunteer for various public service roles, temporarily of course. Could last a few days, or it could last over a month, in one place or bouncing around to different locations where you’re needed. Perhaps you have the same daily job you’re filling in for like a crossing guard, or perhaps you’re going from place to place filling in odd jobs for service projects like rescuing cats.

Notes:
+ Public Service jobs can be anything that improves the happiness of multiple people over the course of at least a few hours.
+ Or improves the safety of an area once the job is completed, such as clearing debris from the road, or allocating shelter for residents of a disaster area.


## Quest: Digital Death
- Slot: Epic
- Faction: Alphazon
- Threat: 10
- Conflict: 7
- Reward: 10

Chief of Alphazon innovations is the Observer matrix and their link to the Data Crypts, providing even their human employees with immortality or safe storage in a digital afterlife of the company’s devising. But something is going wrong: Reapers have taken notice and are causing disturbances and errors in our Data Crypts, killing the digitally immortal & ferrying them away to limbo or elsewhere, including an Exec’s own daughter. This won’t be tolerated, Alphazon is greenlighting a counter offense. A task force called the Helldivers with spectrotrace equipment to see and follow Reaper activity. Teach Death not to mess with Alphazon, retrieve the VIP.

Notes:
+ The security breach is identified and a patch is ready to go live as soon as you complete your mission as to not alert the Reapers that we’re onto their BS.
+ Your Helldiver gear will allow you to force entry into godly domains to retrieve targets -- Do. Not. Get. Caught.

### Sidebar
You can’t keep the Helldiver gear on your person when done, but you can request access to-your gear for monitored excursions. This is because nobody unauthorized can learn of it, or they’ll be silenced.

### Sidebar
Being known for confronting the Reapers isn’t a great rep to have, but it’s reasonably fine. Getting caught intruding in a divine realm? Instant suicide.


## Quest: Job Board
- Slot: Heroic
- Faction: Independent
- Repeatable: True
- Threat: 5
- Conflict: 5
- Reward: 5

A staple of many taverns and guild halls: The Job Board, upon which any random person of interest can post a bulletin with the job in question registered with the owner of the board with the payment handed to the establishment ahead of time. Some boards allow any riff raff to post with or without registration, others require fees to register. Depends on where you go. Use this to customize any quest you wish with rewards based on the threat and conflict rating. The Threat and Conflict can be between 1-3 for Folk tier quests, taking a Folk slot, while Nobles can be between 3-6, 6-8 for Heroic, 8-10 for Epic. Reward is 1/2 Threat + 1/2 Conflict.

Notes:
+ Custom Quests can’t reward special benefits, only rp to purchase something, unless in-game you’re spending that and/or saved rp on a purchase which is rewarded in-context through the quest.
+ Threat and Conflict needs to be at least somewhat warranted by the objects faced by the quest.
+ Indies faction freebie is to make 1 Heroic quest for free, the way they get Heroic’s 10 floors for free in Dungeoneering.
