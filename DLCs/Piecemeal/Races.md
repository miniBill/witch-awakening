An entirely witch and witchknight species, guardians (not technically angels) are never solitary, because each of them is devoted to a particular person, their ward. Guardians always have a vague sense of the well-being of their ward, and use magic more cheaply to aid them or go to their side. Guardians cannot die permanently as long as their ward lives, reviving in one week by their side in the spirit world. The same happens if they die heroically failing to save their ward, which leaves them with Low capacity but constant Low charge for a year if they don’t give up on reviving their ward.
__Guardians draw Mana__ from Protection. They charge from watching over their ward, placing protections on them, and diverting harm. Saving their ward from mortal peril gives High charge for a day, and saving anyone else from major danger gives a Low charge for at least an hour.

As long as a Guardian’s ward is alive and unthreatened, they may choose a new ward. This cuts them off from their old ward immediately and does not replace it for one month. With the old ward’s blessing to change this can drop to a week.
