"Why bother dodging, blocking and running from the spells of your enemy when you can just say no to the spell being cast in the first place? Also a must-have for any teachers working with magically inclined kids".

Counter magic allows you to prevent enemy magic users from casting spells by suppressing their ability to begin casting magic, or by interfering with an ongoing spell. Counter magic can be used to dispel a lingering/permanent magical effect that is at least 1 Rank below the casters' Counter-magic rank. This takes half as much time as it would normally take to establish the lingering/permanent effect. 

_*Rank 0*_: Ability to somewhat accurately sense magic in your immediate surroundings, more powerful magics can sometimes be detected from outside your normal range.

### Rank 1
At rank 1 the range and sensitivity of your magic sense is heightened to the point where you can can recognize any types of magic that you've seen before. You gain the ability to __Dispell__ up to rank 0 magic you've detected within line of sight, cancelling out spells by expending an equal amount of mana.

### Rank 2
At rank 2 your magic sense is further heightened to the point that you can reliably tell how much power is being put into a nearby spell. Your __Dispell__ now works on magic up to rank 1.

### Rank 3
At rank 3 your magic sense is refined further still, you can pinpoint exactly where magic is being cast from. __Dispell__ will now works on magic up to rank 2. You gain the ability to __Suppress__ magic you're able to sense up to rank 1, preventing spells of that rank from being cast (without requiring line-of-sight), this requires a constant low expendature of mana.

### Rank 4
At rank 4 your magic sense is now good enough to recognize the magical signature of a caster who's magic you've sensed before. __Dispell__ will now works on magic up to rank 3, and __Suppress__ now works on magic up to rank 2.

### Rank 5
At rank 5 you are now able to seal someone's magic, preventing them from being able to cast spells or generate mana ever again. In order to seal someone's magic your target must either be completely out of mana or rendered unconscious. This is treated as a rank 5 curse, and can be cured similarly. __Dispell__ will now work on magic up to rank 4, and __Suppress__ on magic up to rank 3.
