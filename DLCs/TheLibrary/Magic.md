## Magic: Counter-Magic
- Class: Academic
- Elements: All
- Has rank zero: True

"Why bother dodging, blocking and running from the spells of your enemy when you can just say no to the spell being cast in the first place? Also a must-have for any teachers working with magically inclined kids".

Counter magic allows you to prevent enemy magic users from casting spells by suppressing their ability to begin casting magic, or by interfering with an ongoing spell. Counter magic can be used to dispel a lingering/permanent magical effect that is at least 1 Rank below the caster’s Counter-magic rank. This takes half as much time as it would normally take to establish the lingering/permanent effect.

_*Rank 0*_: Ability to somewhat accurately sense magic in your immediate surroundings, more powerful magics can sometimes be detected from outside your normal range.

### Rank 1
At rank 1 the range and sensitivity of your magic sense is heightened to the point where you can can recognize any types of magic that you’ve seen before. You gain the ability to __Dispell__ up to rank 0 magic you’ve detected within line of sight, cancelling out spells by expending an equal amount of mana.

### Rank 2
At rank 2 your magic sense is further heightened to the point that you can reliably tell how much power is being put into a nearby spell. Your __Dispell__ now works on magic up to rank 1.

### Rank 3
At rank 3 your magic sense is refined further still, you can pinpoint exactly where magic is being cast from. __Dispell__ will now works on magic up to rank 2. You gain the ability to __Suppress__ magic you’re able to sense up to rank 1, preventing spells of that rank from being cast (without requiring line-of-sight), this requires a constant low expenditure of mana.

### Rank 4
At rank 4 your magic sense is now good enough to recognize the magical signature of a caster who’s magic you’ve sensed before. __Dispell__ will now works on magic up to rank 3, and __Suppress__ now works on magic up to rank 2.

### Rank 5
At rank 5 you are now able to seal someone’s magic, preventing them from being able to cast spells or generate mana ever again. In order to seal someone’s magic your target must either be completely out of mana or rendered unconscious. This is treated as a rank 5 curse, and can be cured similarly. __Dispell__ will now work on magic up to rank 4, and __Suppress__ on magic up to rank 3.


## Magic: Constructs
- Class: Academic
- Elements: All

"When it comes to defending against such things as fireballs, bolts of lightnings, howling gales, and pitchforks thrown by an angry mob, I cannot recommend constructs highly enough".

Constructs is the practice of using mana to generate and telekinetically manipulate solid shapes made of mana, these constructs are also know (somewhat inaccurately) as hard-light. As you go up ranks in constructs the shapes you generate become tougher, can be moved around with more force, can be more complex, and have an increased maximum size. Constructs is a very flexible discipline in combat both defensively and offensively, as well as a very handy tool to have in everyday life

### Rank 1
At first rank you are able to create constructs with the durability of ice in simple geometric shapes, up to one foot in diameter. These constructs can be moved around slowly with a small amount of concentration. Create a plane to deflect and incoming blow, a bar at knee height to trip a pursuer, or make a cube for you to step on in order to reach the top shelf.

### Rank 2
At rank 2 your constructs will have the durability of wood, can be up to one meter across, can be moved around quickly enough to bruise, and can now take slightly more complex shapes. Create a mana-blade, a kite shield, or a spoon

### Rank 3
At rank 3 your constructs will have the durability of iron, can be up to three meter across, can be moved around quickly enough to easily break bones, and can now take even more complex shapes. Create a snowplow, a key, or a spiked barricade.

### Rank 4
At rank 4 your constructs will have the durability of titanium, can be up to ten meter across, can be moved around with enough force to crumple metal, and can now take very intricate shapes. Make a beautifully inlaid sword, functional glasses, or a teapot.

### Rank 5
At rank 5 your constructs are virtually indestructible requiring a concentrated barrage of R5 magic (or the equivalent thereof) to break through, can be up to 30 meters across, can move with enough force to tear through a building, can now take any shape you can accurately envision, and those shapes can now have moving parts. Create a moving vehicle, a paintbrush, or a working gun.


## Magic: Mana-Shaping
- Class: Sorceress
- Elements: All

"Though [Wands] is what we're best known for, it is my opinion that [Mana-shaping] is far more useful to our students and should be thus prioritized. The headmaster has yet to respond".

Mana-shaping, also known as applied thaumics, mana elementalism, or manamancy, is the practice of reflexively shaping and utilizing mana to alter other spells on the fly. While not especially powerful by itself, mana-shaping is a potent force multiplier for other magical disciplines, empowering your magic and opening up new avenues for your spellcasting.

### Rank 1
At rank 1 you gain a 5% passive bonus to all your mana __Generation__ methods, this bonus doubles with every further rank you gain in Mana-shaping. You learn to imbue you spells with a __Lingering__ effect, allowing them to last 10% longer by using ambient mana, this bonus also doubles per rank of Mana-Shaping.

### Rank 2
At rank 2 you benefit from greatly increased __Precision__ with the spells you cast: use hexes to selectively transmute a pattern into an object, control a scalpel with surgical precision using metallurgy, etc. You also become capable of __Excluding__ some targets from the direct effects of your magic: cast a wave of freezing cold that ignores allies, cast an wide-area curse that is selective with its targets etc.

### Rank 3
At rank 3 your spells become slightly more __Powerful__, resulting in a 5% increase to the power of your magic, this bonus increasing by 10% for every rank of Mana-shaping after 3rd. You also learn how to add a Delay to any of your spells, causing them to go off at a pre-set time after being cast.

### Rank 4
At rank 4 your spells become __Anchored__, which means it will cost twice as much mana to dispell them, and warding against them is only half as effective as it would otherwise be. You learn how to imbue a Homing effect into your spells, causing them to seek out targets you designate.

### Rank 5
At rank 5 you get a flat 40% mana-cost __Reduction__, and your __Delay__ is upgraded with Conditions allowing you to set specific conditions by which the spell will be triggered, rather than just putting them on a timer (synergizes very well with runes and contracts). If not anchored with runes conditioned spells will last up to one day per rank before fading away.


## Magic: Empathics
- Class: Sorceress
- Elements: Soul, Life + Mind
- Elementalism: True

"Don't be too quick to judge, Empathics might not let you sunder the earth, but the ability to understand others and share with them is a life skill few fully appreciate".

Also known as empathy magic, Empathics is the magic of emotions and connections. Each level in Empathics improves you resistance to psychological trauma by 50%, though it can never fully protect someone. Note: Empathics does not protect against Psychotics in any way.

### Rank 1
At rank 1 you can __Sense__ strong emotions in your immediate environment (extreme fury, fresh grief, overwhelming joy etc...), and while this sense does not provide any indication of who is feeling that emotion, you can usually figure it out. In addition you gain an instinctive understanding for how to help those around you overcome their personal demons, you could make a small fortune as a therapist.

### Rank 2
At rank 2 your sense over emotions becomes sharper, allowing you not only trace emotions back to their source, but also detect less extreme emotions (joy from someone who had a generally good day, anger at having to wait in traffic, nervousness in the presence of a crush etc...). Empamantics at this rank can be somewhat overwhelming if you're in a crowd.

### Rank 3
At rank 3 Your emotional sense becomes further refined, allowing you to pick up on whichever emotion a person is feeling most strongly at any particular moment. In addition, you become capable of forming a single __soul-bond__ with someone you share a strong positive emotional connection with (this bond is somewhat similar to the bond between a master and familiar). Soul-bonds allow those bonded to sense where each other are (the direction and rough distance), and enables telepathic communication. These bonds break if either of the bonded die, fall asleep/unconscious, are moved to a different plane, or should either of the bonded voluntarily chose to end the bond.

### Rank 4
At rank 4 your emotional sense develop to the point where you can see a person's aura (gain “third eye” perk for free), and by focusing on someone you can pick up on their subtle emotions. You are now able to maintain up to five bonds, and these bonds no longer break when one of the bonded falls asleep. In addition your bonds now allow for the bonded to actively share one of their five sense telepathically, this surprisingly does not cause any disorientation, though it can be distracting.

### Rank 5
At rank 5 you can maintain any number of __Bonds__, limited only by the number of people that you have a strong positive emotional connection to. You are now able to form temporary bonds between two others, lasting 24 hours. A __Bond__ now allows you to share one magic you know with the person you're bonded to.


## Magic: Reinforcement
- Class: Sorceress
- Elements: Body, Metal, Beast

"Don't feel like falling into the stereotype of the bookish and unathletic mage, but also don't want to go through all the effort of actually getting into shape? Are you perhaps already athletic but now want to push past the limits of your mortal form? If you fall into either category then you'll want to learn reinforcement".

Magic that focuses on controlling one's inner self, and has been referred to to as Qi, Chakra, Battle-trance, berserking, and many more names. Many legendary masters of various martial disciplines are practitioners of Reinforcement magic. Reinforcement works by magnifying what you already have, and thus Stacks with various species perks, the Apex perk, and works while shapeshifted. Reinforcement can be toggled on and off at will, and you are able to use any percentage of your maximum boost at your discretion, with lower mana costs to match the amount of Reinforcement you are currently using.

### Rank 1
At rank 1, for a low mana cost you can __Improve__ the strength of your muscles, and the general durability of your body by 50%. This does not come with instinctive knowledge of how to utilize your newfound strength, and is often disorienting for new practitioners.

### Rank 2
At rank 2 your __Improve__ can, for a moderate mana cost, double the strength of your muscles, and the toughness of your body as a whole, whilst providing a moderate boost to your reaction time. Again, this will take practice to get used to.

### Rank 3
At rank 3, for a high mana cost __Improve__ can now multiply your strength and durability by a factor of 4, while also drastically improving your reflexes.

### Rank 4
At rank 4 you learn to utilize other known magics in your reinforcement, up to one school at a time. Give your strikes an electrical charge (Windkeeping), make your bones as strong as steel (Metallurgy), you could even have each strike you land deliver increasingly bad luck (Curse) to your opponents. R1 __Improve__ can now be maintained at no cost, whilst R2 becomes low cost, and R3 becomes moderate cost.

### Rank 5
At rank 5 you are able to use mana to maintain your bodily functions. This means that you may use mana in place of breathing or eating (though malnutrition becomes a problem if you do this too long). It also means that even should your body be damaged beyond the ability to function, so long as you have mana you can keep yourself alive through what would otherwise be fatal harm. This effect has a mana cost that scales in accordance to how much of your bodily functions are being magically replicated, with the loss of function of a single organ (like the heart) being mitigated for relatively low cost, losing most/all of your main organs would rapidly drain your reserves. This cannot save you from brain-damage, so if someone gets your heads it's still game over. In addition, the bonuses from __Improve__ are doubled.


## Magic: Kinomancy
- Class: Sorceress
- Elements: Mind, Body, Beast

"One of the great equalizers of the magical Community, no prizes for guessing why those of us without opposable thumbs are so fond of Kinomancy".

Also known as telekinesis or force-magic (and loosely the inspiration for “The Force”, George Lucas wasn't a witch himself but was close friends with a kinomancer), Kinomancy is the magic of creating and controlling kinetic energy.

Kinomancy works by targeting an area you can see/sense, and is not instant or particularly precise (a fast moving target would be difficult to catch with kinomancy). But what it lacks in precision it makes up for in versatility and power.

### Rank 1
At rank 1 you can __Lift__ up common household items and move them as fast as you might walk.

### Rank 2
At rank 2 your __Lift__ improves enough for you to carry a person, and move objects with enough force to cause bruises and broken bones. You may levitate with this, but be warned: it will be an unpleasant, dizzying, and difficult form of flight.

### Rank 3
At rank 3 your __Lift__ improves to the point where you could pick up a car, and can move objects around fast enough to be lethal. At this stage you learn how to __Crush__ objects by directing force towards a single point, pulling in and squeezing nearby objects. At this rank __Crush__ is strong enough to break ribs and make breathing all but impossible, and could affect an area of up to a 5 meter sphere.

### Rank 4
At rank 4 your __Lift__ improves enough that you could __Lift__ several train cars at once, and can move objects with enough force to threaten a building's structural integrity. Your __Crush__ can now apply enough pressure to outright kill anyone you catch with it, and can cover the area up to 15 meters across.

### Rank 5
At rank 5 your __Lift__ could, with some effort and concentration, rip a mid-sized apartment building from the ground. Your __Crush__ is powerful enough to turn a car into scrap-metal, and could affect an area up to 50 meters across. You also learn to cast __Stasis__, a wide-range spell that drains away kinetic energy from an area, causing objects to be slowed down or held in place. With the same maximum area of crush, if __Stasis__ is spread out it would be very difficult to move through as if objects within are trying to push through liquid tar, while if you were to concentrate the __Stasis__ down onto a small area it would cancel out 99% of all motion.


## Magic: Illusions
- Class: Warlock
- Elements: Mind, Fire, Soul

"Whether you're a mage in battle fooling the senses of your foe, or a bored student causing rude words to appear behind your teacher's head, Illusions is a classical school of magic beloved and bemoaned by many".

The art of creating false impressions and deceiving the senses of a target. Illusion magic might not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think of combat magic, but the ability to control your opponent's perception of reality is not to be underestimated.

Note: Divination can pierce Illusions of lower rank (eg: Someone with Divination rank 3 can see through Illusions of rank 1 or 2). Maintaining Illusion magic requires negligible amounts of mana.

### Rank 1
At rank 1 your illusions that can fool someone's sense of sight, can cover an area up to a one foot wide sphere, and can affect one person at a time. Maintaining the illusion requires considerable focus, to the point that you wouldn't be able to make an illusion while doing anything else. Illusions are static images.

### Rank 2
At rank 2 your illusions can also fool someone's sense of hearing, can be 3 meters across, and can affect 3 people at once. Maintaining an illusion still requires considerable focus, but you could feasibly walk around or perform very simple tasks. An illusion at this rank can move according to your imagination.

### Rank 3
At rank 3 your illusions can now affect Smell and Taste, can be 15 meters across, and can affect 10 people at once. Maintaining the illusion now requires moderate focus. An illusion at this rank can __Draw__ from its' target's imagination to fill in blanks and appear more convincing.

### Rank 4
At rank 4 your illusions are now capable of deceiving all 5 senses, can be 100 meters across, and could be used on 30 people at a time. You'll now be able to maintain an illusion with with only a small amount of focus. Your illusions can now __Draw__ inspiration from their targets: appearing as someone's greatest fear or closest friend, for example.

### Rank 5
At rank 5 your illusions can fool magical senses as well, can be a kilometer across, and can affect up to 100 people, as well as any number of people within the area of the illusion. Your illusions will no longer break no matter how distracted you get, and will only be dispelled when you yourself dismissed them, or when the next full moon rises. For a moderate amount of mana you can now __Bind__ an illusion to someone, causing it to follow them, and requiring no focus from you.


## Magic: Resonance
- Class: Academic
- Elements: Water, Fire, Mind

"Resonance is a school of magic I'm somewhat conflicted on, on the one hand students will often use it to make some of the most distracting and irritating noises imaginable, but on the other hand the ability to suppress sound is very handy for a librarian".

Resonance is the magic school of revolving around the generation and suppression of sound and vibration. Resonance allows you to move in complete silence, to distract and disorient with sound. At the higher ranks, you will be able to fracture, deafen, or fire off shockwaves.

Note: Resonance is notably different from illusions in that while illusions can make you \\*think\\* you hear something, resonance would actually generate a real sound. A microphone would pick up sounds made by resonance, it would not pick up sound from illusion magic.

### Rank 1
At rank 1 you can generate or suppress sounds in a small area, loud enough to irritate someone, or muffle an anomalous car-engine sound you're trying to ignore. Your sense of hearing becomes slightly sharper.

### Rank 2
At rank 2 you can generate enough sound to make someone uncomfortable, or suppress sounds in a wider area. You could prevent eavesdropping by setting up an area of sound suppression, or by making to much noise to hear over.

### Rank 3
At rank 3 you can generate enough sound to cause serious pain or break glass, or mute all but the loudest sounds. Move in near-complete silence, or stun and disorient someone with noise. Your sense of hearing is now at peak human performance.

### Rank 4
At rank 4 you can generate enough sound to cause physical harm, generate harmonic vibrations that can crack or weaken large structures. You can now limit the distance your sonic magic travels or the direction it travels in. You could wound someone with sound without the person beside them hearing a peep.

### Rank 5
At rank 5 you gain an innate sense for the resonant frequency of inanimate objects, and become capable of generating enough sound to cripple or kill an average person. You could at this point easily damage or bring down large structures. Your sense of hearing is now both supernaturally good, and supernaturally resistant to loud noises.


## Magic: Crystal-Crafting
- Class: Sorceress
- Elements: Earth, Fire + Metal
- Elementalism: True

"A truly beautiful form of magic, Crystal-Crafting is worth learning for the artistic potential alone in my opinion. That being said, even the most boorish philistine could find value in the magical benefits Crystal-crafting can offer".

Also known as Crystallomancy, Crystal-Crafting is technically a subset of [Earth-Moving], but it is specialized enough to be considered a school all of its' own.

Crystallomancy allows its' practitioners to move, grow and reshape crystals and gems, but its' greatest capability is using the gems to store, capture, and empower mana and spells.

### Rank 1
At rank 1 you can telekinetically control a small handful of precious gems.

### Rank 2
At rank 2 you become capable of making gems __Grow__ at an accelerated rate, up to 10 grams per minute.

### Rank 3
At rank 3 your ability to __Grow__ gems/crystals much is accelerated, up to 100 grams per minute, and you can now freely reshape them to whichever form you please. "Try not to look suspicious by selling large amounts of precious gems on the mundane market".

### Rank 4
At rank 4 you can __Store__ mana in gems with a 100 gram gem/crystal being able to __Store__ 1/10th the mana as a witch with “low” storage capacity. Gems with magic stored in them will slowly draw in ambient mana up until full, the more mana they currently have in them the faster they will refill. Having a large numbers of such gems in a given area will lead to diminishing recharge rates.

### Rank 5
At rank 5 you can catch spells by drawing them into a gem, though if the magic is being controlled by another it may take a contest of wills to steal it. Once caught, the spell can either be stored for later use or rendered back into raw mana. Note that should a gem be over-filled it will fracture and eventually explode, the more mana stuffed into it the faster it will fracture, and the larger the explosion will be. You will also gain the ability to create empowering gems which, when added to a wand, staff, or other magical artifact/focus, will colour any spells casted through it in a similar manner to how a Sorceress can colour their elementalism. Magic cast through an artifact/focus with an empowering gem is 25% more powerful, and if a sorceress casts through a gem the same colour as their aura, the magic is empowered by 50% instead.


## Magic: Homunculus-Craft
- Class: Warlock
- Elements: Blood, Nature, Earth

"Many a species of monster can trace its' origin to a mage with too much imagination and too little foresight. Please try to be sensible when creating creatures with Homunculus-craft, or at the very least, don't just go releasing failed creations into the wild".

Homunculus Magic revolves around the growth and alteration of flesh-and-blood creatures. A skilled Homunculus mage is capable of creating life anew from the tiniest start, or of making all sorts of alterations to a living being. Homunculus magic can not create souls, but crafted Homonculi can serve as bodies for demons, spirits, or souls summoned by necromancy. Homunculus magic has drastically reduced effect on unwilling sapient beings, and takes longer to affect more intelligent animals.

### Rank 1
At rank 1 you are able to make small __Alterations__ to living beings, like changing the natural colour of someone's hair or eyes, or causing a living creature to grow slightly (5%) faster

### Rank 2
At rank 2 you are able to make moderate __Alterations__ to living beings, like causing feathers to grow on a mammal, or changing someone's height by up to half a meter. You can now cause a living creature to grow 20% faster or slower, and can grant the ability for them to heal twice as fast as they would otherwise, and to heal without scaring.

### Rank 3
At rank 3 you are able to make significant __Alterations__ to living beings, like causing someone to grow functional extra arms, or making a reptile warm-blooded. You are able to cause a living being to grow 75% faster or slower, and can now grant them greater physical strength, double what they should otherwise be capable of.

### Rank 4
At rank 4 you are able to __Alter__ a living being as you please, so long as they are still made of flesh and blood (with naturalism Rank 4+ you can incorporate plant matter). Able to make a living being grow 300% faster or slower. Altered beings can be made supernaturally durable, twice as tough as they would naturally be.

### Rank 5
At rank 5 you are able to grow a __Homunculus__, a body to your exact specifications, starting with any biological matter. You are now able to accelerate a living being's natural growth by up to 1000%, or halt it entirely. While creating a __Homunculus__ you can imbue it with up to 10 effects from the magics you know (for example, [Firecalling] could be used to give a __Homunculus__ fire-breath).


## Magic: Advanced Golemancy
- Class: Academic
- Elements: Body, Earth, Life

"You may have noticed that I have a number of charming little golems flittering about the place, I don't think I could keep this labyrinth of a library in any semblance of order without them".

Based on Hexes, Advanced Golemancy is as much an academic profession as it is a magic school. Dedicated golemancers create highly intricate magical servants out of inanimate matter, using a variety of methods and means to add various effects and abilities to their creations.

You do not require any other schools of magic to learn Advanced Golemancy, but some schools certainly help. For every 3 ranks of [Hexes] or [Runes] that you possess gain a free rank in golemancy (for example, if you had [Hexes] 2 and [Runes] 1 you would get 1 free level in Advanced Golemancy).

### Rank 1
At rank 1 you can animate simple magical mechanisms: pulleys, levers, automated doors etc. It may not sound all that impressive, but everyone has to start somewhere.

### Rank 2
At rank 2 you become capable of animating human-sized (though not necessarily human-shaped) statues to serve you. These statues are made of a single material and will either require a soul to animate it, or will behave like a video-game AI.

### Rank 3
At rank 3 you learn to diversify your golems, allowing for up to 3 material to be used in its' construction. Your golems can vary in size from being child sized, to being half-again as large as an average adult human. They are now twice as durable as their base materials would normally be.

### Rank 4
At rank 4 your golems can be made of 5 materials, and be imbued with magical effects up to rank 2 from schools you know, for example: a hovering golems by using Kinomancy. Their max and min sizes are now 3x and 1/3 the max and min from rank 3.

### Rank 5
At rank 5 your golems can have 3 rank 3 magics imbued into each of them, they are 4 times as tough as their base materials, and can be 3 times larger or smaller than a rank 4 golem. Your golems can now slowly self-repair, having lost mass slowly move back towards them and re-integrate into where they were before. By studying the Phylactery of a Lich you have learned how to bind yourself to a souless golem. While bound in this way, you share a hivemind-like telepathic connection with the golem, able to easily control, command, share senses with, or even possess them. Should you die while you are bound in this way to any golems, you may choose to have your spirit possess one of them.


## Magic: Spirit-Weaving
- Class: Warlock
- Elements: Life, Soul, Necro

"A most noble school of magic that will allow you to shape wonderous new life from raw mana, Spirit-weaving is one of the most incredible magics you witches have ever come up with. Yes, I'm a bit biased". 

Also known as Conjuration, Spirit-weaving is the art of creating living spirits from your mana. 

These spirits are loyal to the one who made them within reason, they are as "alive" as other living being, and being abused may lead to them abandoning, or even attacking their maker.

Spirits may be used in place of souls for things like necromancy or golemancy, but don't expect a devil to accept one as payment if you've made some promises you shouldn't have.


### Rank 1
At rank 1 you can create wisps, small ephemeral spirits capable of delivering messages, observing and relaying information, or acting as a light source. These spirits are extremely simple, and have no capacity for independent thought or introspection.

### Rank 2
At rank 2 you can create small spirits that can take the form of a mundane animal, roughly as capable of introspection and independent thought as a swarm insect, like an ant. Rank 2 spirits can be Imbued with one rank one magic that you possess.

### Rank 3
At rank 3 you can create spirits up to human size that can be a mix of physical traits from any two mundane species, "Though you don't have to mix creatures together if you don't want to, sometimes keeping things simple, and feathery, works best". These spirits are roughly as capable of introspection and independent thought as a small reptile, like a salamander. Rank 3 spirits can be Imbued with up to 3 rank 2 magics that you possess.

### Rank 4
At rank 4 you can create spirits up to the size of a grizzly bear, which can be a mix of any two mundane or fantastical species. These spirits are roughly as capable as introspection and independent thought as moderately intelligent mammal, like a rat. Rank 4 spirits can be imbued with up to 9 rank 3 magic that you possess

### Rank 5
At rank 5 you can now create __Noble__ spirits, beings with the same capacity for introspection and independent thought as any human. A __Noble__ spirit can be up to the size of a school-bus, and can be imbued with any number of rank 3 magics you know yourself. Over time these spirits will grow in power, reaching rank 4 in their imbued magics after one century, and rank 5 after one millennium.
