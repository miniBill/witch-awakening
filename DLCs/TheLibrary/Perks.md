## Perk: Full Steam Ahead
- Element: Water
- Class: Sorceress
- Cost: 4

Free with [Waterworking] 3+.

You can move at 50mph though water without feeling the ill effects of water resistance, and have a sonar-like sense that gives you a perfect 3 dimensional map of your surroundings when submerged. If you have witchery, you can add you maximum broom speed to your swim speed.


## Perk: Whispering Wind
- Element: Wind
- Class: Sorceress
- Cost: 4

An unusual knack which allows one to carry their voice on the wind. This ability only works within line of sight, or if it's a nearby area you already know extremely well. Whisper in the ear of an ally, speak softly and be heard perfectly clearly by an entire crowd or if you're feeling particularly obnoxious, shout directly in someone's ear.


## Perk: Scroll-making
- Element: All
- Class: Academic
- Cost: 10

Learn to create scrolls with a one-time use elemental spell built into them. Making a scroll costs three times as much mana as using the spell would normally cost, but once created, can be used by anyone. Whoever holds the scroll instinctively knows what magic is contained within it, and how to use it. Be warned, scrolls can be used by a mundane human, and losing track of one could easily lead to a masquerade violation.


## Perk: Sealing Wards
- Element: All
- Class: Warlock
- Cost: 15

Ever heard one of those stories where some great evil is sealed away for one thousand years? This is the magic that does that, a highly-specialized runic art based on Djinn lamps which allows one to seal a (willing or incapacitated) living (or unliving) being away within a specially prepared vessel. They will be held in stasis for a period of 1000 years, or until the vessel is broken.


## Perk: Magic Muffins and cursed cookies
- Element: Body
- Class: Academic
- Cost: 2

Learn to imbue magics and potions you know into the food you make. Create a cake that heals, or a batch of cookies that cure hangovers. Fae are particularly notorious for utilizing this in conjunction with covenant magics.


## Perk: Monster-Tamer
- Element: Beast
- Class: Warlock
- Cost: 6

Monsters just seem so much more... docile around you. With most monsters having lower levels of aggression, and a newfound tendency towards learning and conditioning, you can safely be near and even directly handled otherwise deadly creatures... usually. If a monster goes a week spending at least 8 hours a day in your presence this docile effect becomes permanent. This perk has no effect on sentient monsters.
