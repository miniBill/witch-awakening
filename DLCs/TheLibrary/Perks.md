## Perk: A kind Fate
- Element: Nature
- Class: Warlock
- Cost: 3

You have been blessed by a kind fate, or more accurately, your pets have. Fate will twist ever so slightly to keep your beloved beasties from harm, and so long as you don't put them in harm's way, you can expect them to live unusually long and very happy lives.


## Perk: Chance Mage
- Element: Soul
- Class: Sorceress
- Cost: 8

Gain the ability to minorly influence probability, increase the chance of a coin coming up heads, of a pair of dice rolling snake eyes, or of the old floorboards under your opponent giving way at just the right time. The more chaotic an environment is, the more room there is for this magic to take hold, and the more pronounced the effect will be.


## Perk: Full Steam Ahead
- Element: Water
- Class: Sorceress
- Cost: 4

Free with [Waterworking] 3+.

## Perk: Whispering Wind
- Element: Wind
- Class: Sorceress
- Cost: 4

An unusual knack which allows one to carry their voice on the wind. This ability only works within line of sight, or if it's a nearby area you already know extremely well.

## Perk: Scroll-making
- Element: All
- Class: Academic
- Cost: 10

Learn to create scrolls with a one-time use elemental spell built into them. Making a scroll costs three times as much mana as using the spell would normally cost, but once created, can be used by anyone.

Be warned, scrolls can be used by a mundane human, and losing track of one could easily lead to a masquerade violation.


## Perk: Sealing Wards
- Element: All
- Class: Warlock
- Cost: 15

Ever heard one of those stories where some great evil is sealed away for one thousand years? This is the magic that does that, a highly-specialized runic art based on Djinn lamps which allows one to seal a (willing or incapacitated) living (or unliving) being away within a specially prepared vessel.

## Perk: Monster-Tamer
- Element: Beast
- Class: Warlock
- Cost: 6

Monsters just seem so much more... docile around you. With most monsters having lower levels of aggression, and a newfound tendency towards learning and conditioning, you can safely be near and even directly handled otherwise deadly creatures... usually.

Artifacts from this world range wildly in power and ability, but the ones you're awarded in this cyoa will roughly equivalent to Rank 3 magic (though they are technically not themselves magical).
