- Quote: _*“Has anyone seen Rachel around? We have a double date in 20 minutes and she totally vanished.” - an Arcadian student.*_

Rachel is very introverted and socially awkward, she grew up largely alone without a lot of interaction, so other people may as well be aliens for her and she freaks out about saying the wrong thing, but once she makes real friends she cares for them a lot and can find her stride. She’s very fond of animals and spends a lot of time with her cat, and going on walks alone as to not bother anybody.

Anne is a bit of an oddball. Rather than simply being introverted, she’s pretty much outright antisocial seeing no need or reason to bother and actively prefers keeping a smaller friend group, but she tries to do right by those that do make that cut. She’s known for sleeping most her days away and not just in her bed, but anywhere she goes, some think she has narcolepsy; but she just enjoys dreams a ton.

She has a calm reserved intelligence about the way she carries herself in a mature manner that suggests a lot of life experience that has seen some of the worst life has to offer, but also some of the best, and she appreciates what she can. She’s a bit of a watchdog, always locking out for others, friend or rival.

Tess is a bit of a nonviolent delinquent. She first awakened as a witch out of anger when she inadvertently hexed her human school bully into a slug, being a Warlock rather than an Academic, things are more instinctual and primal for her rather than well understood, and is somewhat easily annoyed, can trigger reactionary hexes with stray impulses, giving her a bad rep, but is cunning and personable when she wants to be and gets along when she needs to.

Evelynn is a high functioning socialite that always seems to know what someone needs to hear to get back on their feet or to keep a party going.

John is a very uncommon male witch... And rarer still: A Changeling. He can’t remember much of his past so doesn’t know how old he really is, but he tries to look as old as he can, He must have been a soldier or knight pre-awakening, because he has a firmly rooted sense of chivalry, justice, and mercy, and great reflexes and is a natural with weapons He’s eager to learn all he can and studies his lessons closely.

Saya is an experienced but still new witch that was motivated with the help of Elaina to improve herself, and ever since has been driven with focus, mostly just to try to get the attention of Elaina.

Fran is a retired Hawthorne professor who has taken to Arcadia, where she was a private tutor to Elaina as a favor to her mother, who was her own teacher when she was younger.

Ashley has been moved between two house already. She isn’t a delinquent, but... she’s an eccentric airhead with a goldfish-like memory at least when it comes to rules or lessons.

If Willpower is a shield, Determination is the sword, the active driving force to push forward. Mae is determined to become the best and never fail another again since she lost a student to a band of goblinoids who couldn’t be recovered for 4 days and was never the same. She’s strict and can come across as cold, but would rather die than fail a student again. Uses similar methods to Eliza but much less, ah, _intrusive_.

Laura is the only witch born to an Alfheimr noble lineage known for their talented witches. She’s grown up with the pressure of her family name and a deep need to satisfy expectations. She has a natural desire to see others exceed as well, and may seem overly serious or sharp when dealing with others who aren’t living up to their potential, but she just wants them to succeed.

Carol is a dangerous combination of Aurai and a chatterbox halfling mimi. To keep her from withering people with her voice, she’s tasked with biting down on a various bits when not sure it’s safe, only around various witches or creatures that don’t age can she let loose and she’ll talk endlessly about all the different things she wanted to say during the day, even if only talking to herself as she drifts to sleep.

- Quote: _*“Suzy may not kill people these days but she sure doesn’t seem to have any reservations with using others for her experiments.” - A teacher*_

Suzy is a poison specialist alchemist that always has multiple projects ongoing. She’s very numb to traumas such that she can appear sociopathic but it’s not that she doesn’t feel as much as she never learned to care and her emotions have been burned from a very rough first century of life. Now she just focuses on her craft in Hawthorne.

Like most Hawthorne staff, Noriko was once a student herself, a star of her class with something of a wild streak: which many would say is an understatement. Not many people know why, but she withdrew from the public eye and into herself and her studies, adopting a new appearance to turn to teaching under a new name. She’s a house lead of House Mooncrest where she councils with a gentle hand.

They aren’t wrong, Isaac is a Crusader that participated in most at least seven different crusades. He’s a Warlock with an angry soul that simmers in a fine boil for the rape and murder of his entire family while he was away on campaign, which is what caused his Witch Awakening wherin a Balor emerged out from his rage which was stopped by a Contemplar when it nearly killed him too.

Ifra grew up Muslim and managed to live a full life until the old age of 83 when she finally had her awakening -- into a changeling finding herself young again. A little more than she’d have hoped but hey. She believes in Islam though she’s lived long enough to see a lot of changes, that she just adapts to whatever the local custom is, otherwise she’s somewhat casual, but makes sure to pray 5 times a day.

Jen... is not a typical agent or employee of Alphazon. She’s a daughter of a high level executive that grew up never knowing the feeling of being unable to get something she wanted and was a designer baby derived from daeva genetics.

- Quote: _*“I haven’t seen this happen before, are you seeing the same thing? This vision is just static to me.” - Penelope.*_

Rose is a quiet witch, speaking seems to fatigue her, but she'll reply or say things when important. The Veil hides her from everyone else, as a monster would be hidden from a mortal, she is hidden from even witches. Even physically moving things to try to convey a message is obscured or dismissed in some way: If you select her as a Companion you will be the only one who can sense her, and can be seen in the background of casual daily life as though she’s just watching the life go by of everyone else, vanishing and appearing suddenly. She’ll write in a small notebook, the pages look like static to you. Sometimes she’ll help you with single written words or pointing. She’s very passive and not very helpful, but your life seems to become more interesting. *You can take any 1 extra Quest.*

You receive the egg of an eldritch child of the Far God of your choice (Affecting the aesthetic). This egg needs to be incubated, either in a living womb (yours or another’s), or in a sufficiently advanced or occult chamber. Once the egg has been fed the blood of 100 different souls one way or another, it hatches into a beast of your design up to the size of beasts shown in Metamorphosis, and is a witch of a chosen type. The monster will have a personality reflecting its Far God but will be loyal to you, more so if you bore it yourself to the point of going against its own nature with a telepathic bond.
