## Quest: Cart Theory
- Slot: Folk
- Evil Route: True
- Threat: 1
- Conflict: 1
- Reward: 1

There is no dire emergency. You are physically capable. Do you accept your duty to return the cart to the pen / deposit, even though you gain nothing?

No one will punish you for not returning the shopping cart, no one will fine you, or kill you for not returning the shopping cart, you gain nothing by returning the shopping cart. You must return the shopping cart out of the goodness of your own heart. You must return the shopping cart because it is the right thing to do. Because it is correct and requires next to no effort.

Are you capable of self-governing?

Notes:
+ There are no short term consequences of this decision.
+ Do you leave a quarter in the lock, undermining the purpose of the locking in favor of feeling like you do helped the next user?
+ Do you sanitize the handlebars before and/or after?
+ Is the wheel particularly squeaky?


## Quest: House Fire
- Slot: Folk
- Evil Route: True
- Threat: 2
- Conflict: 1
- Reward: 2

The house of a non-witch or new low rank witch that you are on friendly terms with, or a relative of, will catch fire into a severe inferno, and you’ll be in a position to respond, being within actionable distance and aware of the fire occurring after it kicks off. This fate will prioritize a home that you share with them sometimes, such as if you have roommates or a parents house you sometimes visit and have property stored. This factors any transportation and communication abilities or resources you possess, you could be in another dimension and receive a bad feeling or HexVPN / GhostNet communications that warns you something is wrong.

Notes:
+ Do you evacuate people, pets, and objects?
+ Do you fight the fire by some means? A number of magics could help, chances are it is on Earth, which could limit your actions within the Masquerade. Watchers or ORC will cover up low evidence of magic, like oddities in forensics.

### Sidebar
They cover up evidence in general, it’s not a faction issue.

If you’re evil, you can instead be fated to cause a house fire that causes the death of someone close to a high status good character, or scarring of someone fully innocent and kind.


## Quest: Domesticated
- Slot: Folk
- Threat: 1
- Conflict: 1
- Reward: 1

Fate will conspire to guarantee that at some point in your life you will have a window of clarity and peace, and situations aligned such that you have a guaranteed opportunity to have a healthy wholesome domestic life at some point, with a home, a partner, and a child that came into your life the old fashioned way or by chance. You’ll have up to 20 years of peace, but the peace could begin to fade as early as 6 years in, at your discretion, depending on how much adventure you want to inject into the later years with the child and partner. Your circumstance will align such that you genuinely feel a sense of ease, relaxation, and nothing particularly rough will occur.

Notes:
+ The child and partner are not necessarily a witch themselves. Most witches bear human or non-witch magical race offspring.
+ Human or not, you can still let them know about magic and break the hold of the Veil on them by a number of means.
+ They will have a compatible likable personality.

### Sidebar
If you take House Fire, this synergizes- When your grace period ends, it is your own home that goes ablaze, giving an extra {2} Reward Points.


## Quest: Street Racer
- Slot: Folk
- Threat: 3
- Conflict: 2
- Reward: 3

At some point you somehow find yourself involved with a group of street racers, which as it turns out is a hobby that attracts certain types of witches who appreciate the underground quality to it and I have an affinity for rides, and it’s less dangerous when you’re semi-immortal beings. Alchemical nitrus potions, firecalling rocket boosts, windkeeping tailwinds, witch races can get wild. On Earth the rules limit to subtle effects, but they tell you about incredible death races off Earth that hold nothing back. Maybe you’ll see one some day. For now, you’re among very welcoming group of people that love cars and form an extended family.

Notes:
+ You can participate as you wish, as moral support, mechanics, or join the race yourself. If you have Hellrider, you can customize it or integrate it into any other vehicle you get your hands on, but Broomstick speed boosts are restricted to off-earth races.
+ Perhaps a / some of your Companions are in on it


## Quest: Party Animal
- Slot: Folk
- Threat: 1
- Conflict: 2
- Reward: 3

Looks like you have one hell of a party in your fate. Whether it’s a major celebration after a more challenging quest of your own or someone else, random occasion, or your own hard work and planning or contribution, you’ll at some point attend an amazing party, parade, festival, or otherwise event that will be talked about for decades to come with fond and novel memories, it might even last a whole week. Whether it’s some saturnalian festivity of debauched thrills, or a simple meaningful night of karaoke with a small group of friends, it will be a night to remember, and whatever your normal reservations, you’ll feel comfortable and at home.

Notes:
+ Design a party of your dreams, small or large.
+ What kinds of memories did you make during it?
+ Did you plan it or help set up? Is it held for you or someone else?
+ Family Friendly, or very much not?
+ Mundane, or Magical in nature? Is it even on Earth?


## Quest: Gone Feral
- Slot: Noble
- Threat: 5
- Conflict: 2
- Reward: 5

Deep in the largest forests on your continent, a tribe of wood elves and dryads have thrived for centuries clinging to their heritage and native ways. However, something is disturbing the local wildlife and is killing their hunters. An ambush by a pack of Dire Wolves went straight for the throat- An intelligent attack that took the lives of their most capable guardians and sages, including their Naturalist Witch matriarch, her soul unable to be reborn, restrained by a foul presence in the Alpha wolf, a soulstealing curse on its fang and claw. Their numbers have gone from numbering in the 100s, to just 34 remaining tribesmen and women. They desperately need help!

Notes:
+ If harmed by the Alpha Dire Wolf, you can’t benefit from any means of resurrection or reincarnation, natural or magical.
+ Killing the Alpha or dispelling its curse can free trapped souls.
+ Dire Wolves, while aggressive and violent, aren’t usually this malicious, and can’t weave a curse like this itself.


## Quest: Just Desserts
- Slot: Noble
- Threat: 6
- Conflict: 4
- Reward: 6

For any number of reasons, you’ve found yourself at an elaborate dinner party celebrating the wedding between a local princess and a merchant prince known for making his wealth through the cheap mass production of medicines sold at just enough to make a profit, thanks to his usage of Golemwork for automation. They’re both beloved by everyone. And yet, in the middle of the dance, they are both struck with a gruesome death. The large estate is sealed off from outside magics and the borders immediately slam shut on lockdown, thick layers of antimagic wards fully enclose the estate.

Until the murderer is caught, every day 1-3 deaths will turn up.

Notes:
+ Each body appears to have a stab wound among other injuries, could it relate to why the souls are missing?
+ The killer must be an Outsider that didn’t expect the lockdown, and are trying to cause as much suffering and terror as they can in order to invoke Far Gods to break themselves free.

### Sidebar
The Murderer seems to resist the antimagic fields, and whatever is allowing it, is affecting you too -- but you both effectively have the Dysfunction complication for the quest


## Quest: Ghost Stories
- Slot: Noble
- Threat: 6
- Conflict: 3
- Reward: 5

In a rural town you by some means overhear the hushed terrified whispers that a group of teenagers went searching for two of their missing friend who they claim have fallen victim to the “Witch of the Woods” who cursed the town long ago, every 20 years kids go missing, for the past 200 years. If you check with the factions, nobody has heard of the case. Pulling on the thread yourself however, you’ll unravel a town full of supernatural occurrences and come to learn the inhabitants are under some subtle compulsion preventing them from leaving and making outsiders less aware of the town, even from Reapers who’d ferry spirits to safety.

Notes:
+ An isolated ecosystem that’s been cut off from Reapers, the inhabitants denied afterlives, left to wander the region until they go insane or fall victim to predatory spirits, evolving into spirit beasts and monsters such as Poltergeists, Banshees, & other dangers that are well fed enough to affect the material world.

### Sidebar
The avoidance compulsion seems strong, however you ended up there, outside help is unlikely. What’s going on here?


## Quest: On Silver Wings
- Slot: Noble
- Evil Route: True
- Threat: 5
- Conflict: 3
- Reward: 3

A close friend or family member... or at least a wealthy patron, has been afflicted by a horrific curse causing agony and soulburn. If they succumb to this curse, they face True Death, urgently requiring a specific potion before the next New Moon. The problem is, the potion requires silver blood of a feathered unicorn, creatures of divine grace, light, and purity -- and extraordinarily rare, unlikely to even appear on Earth. You must enter the Faewilds and seek out the unicorn and obtain its blood. The intelligent creature cannot tolerate evil or corruption and is equivalent to a Rank 5 class Witch in raw magic potential utilizing light based magics.

Notes:
+ If you can be considered “Good” aligned and unselfish, the unicorn can be bargained with to willingly give a vial of silverblood
+ If you also have a female form without male aspects, the unicorn may be more friendly, even loving, and give silverblood in exchange for your time, and becomes an ally.

### Sidebar
If you kill the unicorn, you obtain a treasure trove of very rare potion / ritual ingredients, and the horn can improve any Rod or wand to increase magical potency by 10%.

### Sidebar
As an ally, the unicorn can provide silverblood in the future, feathers, and come to your aid in times of great need. Otherwise is good company when you visit.


## Quest: On my Mark
- Slot: Noble
- Threat: 4
- Conflict: 6
- Reward: 4

You’ve received either a bounty tip or an assassination mark for a wanted rogue witch, or a nosy witch who stuck their nose in the wrong person’s business or were in the wrong place at the wrong time. They’re wanted dead or alive either way. If you take them alive, the Threat and Reward both increase by 2 points as they resist. They’ll have at least two tier 4 magics, plus a random assortment of 1-3 rank magics, making them an either an experienced and capable witch, or a naturally gifted witch in over their head. They have allies of similar standard to your own, being a member of a major faction with a companion from that faction.

Notes:
+ If evil, the client prefers them alive and roughed up a little.
+ If good, the ORC or Watchers hosting the bounty don’t have a preference for alive or dead, but will find any prisoner abuse distasteful or potentially criminal, but they’re wanted for some serious reason, such as burning an orphanage.


## Quest: The Mathematician
- Slot: Heroic
- Threat: 7
- Conflict: 4
- Reward: 7

A form of magic that pops up from time to time. By nature it’s hard to describe, but to be brief; High Order Mathematics is a very raw form of magic that unfailingly renders the practitioner insane, not from unnatural memetic hazards, but the raw understanding and changes in perspective utilizing numerals and characters of the First Language used in Runes, The Mathematician is an insane witch, but a glimpse in their mind is like looking upon a Far God -- chaotic, esoteric, unpredictable. The Mathematician is capable of replicating any magic effect, and many unknown magic effects, but is thoroughly insane- And for some reason, they’ve fixated on you.

Notes:
+ They aren’t malicious, but in their fixation they’re experimenting on you with any number of parameters. They want -- need -- to know everything about you, remaining distant but engineering scenarios that test some quality or attribute of yours, even as simple as “How do they react to becoming a cat” -- or much worse.

### Sidebar
To be clear, the Mathematician is an insane stalker, who is one of the most powerful non-deities in the setting, & highly paranoid, almost never in-person.

### Sidebar
They aren’t an ally, and observe you remotely. They make your life more interesting and hazardous, but might intervene to save you from True Death, but not hardships, until bored.


## Quest: Pack Tactics
- Slot: Heroic
- Threat: 8
- Conflict: 3
- Reward: 7

Requires *Gone Feral*. You track down the source of the soulstealing curse within the dire wolves, leading you to discover that the pack of dire wolves are just an offshoot from the greater Lycanthrope packs that are currently embroiled in a blood feud. Werewolves Hulking hominid beasts between 8 and 12ft in height full of tense muscle. Immune to damage except from silver weapons, or Golden Relics, with strength sufficient to crush through concrete walls and shred steel plating like paper, or hurling an elephant across a football field. They are all overwhelmed by bloodlust currently, with the Soulstealer curse, as feral as though it were a full moon.

Notes:
+ They can leap hundreds of meters in height and distance
+ Their movements in straight lines are a blur.
+ Luckily for you, their violence is primarily concentrated on each other -- A war of succession seems to be going on.
+ 8+ werewolves, 2 alphas, dozens of dire wolves.

### Sidebar
If you survive a werewolf bite, you become a werewolf yourself. Werewolves do not have conscious thought in werewolf form, and are forced to transform on full moons.

### Sidebar
It takes decades to gain self-mastery sufficient to force a conscious change, starting out at a few minutes at a time before changing back or losing control.


## Quest: Death Racer
- Slot: Heroic
- Threat: 7
- Conflict: 5
- Reward: 8

Requires *Street Racer*. You’re in the big leagues now. Once every 5 years the Death Race is hosted in a random location anywhere off Earth and there are no limits placed on magic usage, barring only soulstealing or curses that lasts beyond the duration of the race. The caveat is that all participants are hooked up into limiters that regulate mana capacity and mana flow. Instead, you have a series of pellets honed to allow the usage of one magic effect of a given rank. You have 1 Ruby pellet (r5), 3 Sapphire pellets (r4), 9 Emerald pellets (r3), and 20 Citrine pellets (r2), r1 magic is unlimited. Any augmentations to your vehicle is separate & functions normally.

Notes:
+ Tactics vary from witches that put everything they’ve got into speed, while some focus on making sure nothing else is alive to cross the finish line before them.
+ Races are designed to require an average time of 2+ hours before the 1st place gets claimed.

### Sidebar
If you are not a racer, racers can have “support crew” they can call in for service or support up to 3 times per day for up to an hour per stay, having only 1 of each pellet per visit.

### Sidebar
The racer can lend support crew their own pellets for use, if needed. Support crew can bring items with them, even leaving relics behind. Also, food and water.


## Quest: Broken Point
- Slot: Heroic
- Threat: 7
- Conflict: 4
- Reward: 7

A clan of intelligent giant albino elks are calling in favors to seek help, a wild rift has ripped open in their territory and alien creatures roam through to hunt the elk down and drag them back through the rift. While fairly strong with some innate magic of their own, they prove no match for the creatures. They need to put an end to it. Next time the rift opens, fight the creatures back and enter to find an exotic plane consisting entirely of biomatter with fleshy earth, boney spires arching through the sky, teeming with fleshy equivalents to plant life forming jungles, as far as you know this plane is unknown to witchdom and unexplored.

Notes:
+ How are these creatures (of your description) opening rifts? Spontaneous evolution, their own intelligent pursuit of magical knowledge? or random chance opening a natural wild rift?
+ Perhaps there are survivors that were taken for some other reason, or simply not yet killed / eaten.


## Quest: Necropolis
- Slot: Heroic
- Threat: 9
- Conflict: 3
- Reward: 8

An ancient lich thought to be defeated with the destruction of their phylactery has been busy for 600 years. Stray rumors over the years occasionally being investigated with no evidence. Beneath Himalayas the lich founded a new lair and has employed spatial distortion and Domain magics to convert the bottom of a deep cave system into a veritable hollow earth greater in size than Hawthorne’s metropolis- Populated entirely of countless undead. Evidently keeping “livestock” including humans in their main palace sustained by magic to keep creating new life to utilize their skeletons in death. A city carved of stone and built up in bone.

Notes:
+ A Rank 6 tier necromancer skilled in potions, runes, earthmoving, dominion, witchery, and familiarity with a bone dragon familiar.
+ Very stealthily abducts new creatures & humans sometimes.
+ Intends to initiate full scale war on humanity once built up enough to risk breaking the Masquerade.

### Sidebar
The situation could easily devolve to be worth an Epic quest if you make a mistake, but the number of possible outcomes keep this as a Heroic quest instead.

### Sidebar
Bear in mind the dangers of necromancers’ ability to trap souls.


## Quest: Tainted Grail
- Slot: Epic
- Evil Route: True
- Threat: 9
- Conflict: 6
- Reward: 8

If you have the Nymph’s Vessel, you’ll notice its waters running red one day: Something terrible has happened at the Baths of the Nymphs. A Hespatian family has broken through their wards and massacred the nymphs, butchering the women in their waters, staining them red and have stolen the Holy Grail, the golden relic 29, and used this act of bloodshed to corrupt it into a twisted opposite of itself. Contact with its waters is an absolute poison and causes an instant transition to undeath moving in a wave over the still living victim’s body. Living flesh within a mile of the grail sickens and begins to turn black.

Notes:
+ You must hunt down the invaders and find a way to restore the grail and restore its place in the Central Fountain, bringing the Baths back to life, and the bodies of the nymphs within.
+ The Nymphs are the primary distributor of the components for healing potions, there will be a major shortage.

### Sidebar
The nymphs will be very thankful and give you free access to the baths. A villain may instead claim the tainted grail for themselves, damning the Nymphs and forever creating a major disruption to the availability of healing potions.

### Sidebar
Be careful with what you do with the grail... If you lost it in the ocean it could slowly poison all waters on Earth causing rampant undead outbreaks, and all the gods will stand in judgment of you with fates worse than death.


## Quest: Dragon Hunt
- Slot: Epic
- Threat: 10
- Conflict: 4
- Reward: 10

Elder Dragons are apocalyptic beasts. They are to dragons what dragons are to riding drakes. The size of a literal mountain, Elder Dragons were banished from Earth by the gods and archangels, early on before the Great Flood. There’s 5 in the solar system currently, one on Mercury, Venus, Titan, Europa, and Pluto. 1+ others are known to have left the solar system, and there are a few dozen known to be scattered through the realms and elemental planes. They share the statistics of a dragon as seen in Metamorphosis, but are scaled up by a thousand and are intelligent, utilizing Relics from their hoard to work magic effects.

Notes:
+ Pick a location of your choice, for some reason the Elder Dragon of choice has become agitated and active, lashing out and if it’s in the solar system, its roars are being picked up on human scientific equipment. It needs to be silenced one way or another.
+ Nothing escapes and Elder Dragon bite, not even spirits.


## Quest: Sanguine Light
- Slot: Epic
- Threat: 9
- Conflict: 5
- Reward: 6

You’ve run afoul of an ancient Vampire Lord through some means, from insult or challenge, or your actions against their clan. They are a high level Hespatian with a family that oversees other families, and is the same vampire that turned the Red Mother. A Vampire Lord is almost as strong as a Werewolf and half as fast, but with more agility, keeping speed with fine movements or focusing to execute preplanned movements that seem like teleportation. They are powerful magic users capable of Necromancy without being a witch, and effectively have the Blood Witch perk. They regenerate from harm so long as one undying cell is intact.

Notes:
+ This Vampire Lord IS in fact a witch as well. Their magics are boosted by 100% so long as they’re well-fed (1 cup a day, decays over 3 days to 0%). Sunlight reduces all magic potency by -75%, along with strength, speed, and regeneration. Garlic is just pungent. Running water burns as a nuisance.

### Sidebar
Holy Symbols just make them uncomfortable. A Vampire is a self-animated corpse that feeds on spirit traces in living blood to sustain their own amalgam spirit. It is not the same person as it was in life - unless an Empusa, or Necromancy is employed to rebind the spirit back to the same body to bypass the change, allowing a true conversion. If bitten and die, you become a normal vampire (See Immortal Blood Vol.), unless you slay and drink a Lord’s blood to become one yourself.


## Quest: Mad Bomber
- Slot: Epic
- Threat: 7
- Conflict: 10
- Reward: 6

A crazed explosion witch initiated a terrorist plot and severely violated the Masquerade. With careful planning and skillfully avoiding divination and probability engines, was able to simultaneously bomb 27 cities. On Earth, and seemed to deliberately make sure that each “bomb” destroyed assets of powerful magical beings and witches of each major faction, popular Gateway networks, and so on. And they did so under your name, wearing your face (or your most used face). With a severe Masquerade violation, the gods are involved, with Rank 10 equivalent magics, time is completely stopped, a world in stasis.

Notes:
+ Celestial and Infernal agents of gods and high level Faction leaders are combing the streets and employing a form of domain bubble capable of rewinding local time to peer into the past and live, as though present, to seek answers. You are freed from stasis for questioning and to contribute to the investigation.

### Sidebar
Explore a world frozen in time and use the temporary power granted to you to walk the past to uncover what happened, why, and who did this, as you work with angels, demons, and faction leaders to resolve the situation and rebuild before humanity wakes.

### Sidebar
Tensions will remain high and you’ll remain under observation the entire time, after an intense period of questioning and initial detainment. It can be dangerous if you play your cards poorly, you can only imagine what it’d be like if you actually broke the Masquerade... I mean, you didn’t do it... right? You believe so...


## Quest: Deep Whispers
- Slot: Epic
- Threat: 10
- Conflict: 10
- Reward: 10

A cult of Outsiders to a particular Far God have succeeded in creating a corrupted Domain around an entire city of your choice outside of Europe, China, America, or Japan. They’ve filled that city with waking nightmares and unspeakable crimes for a 1 month period shielded from the eyes of the divine and Godsight Array satellites.. They have managed to tear rifts in the aether sufficient to have invoked the Avatar of a Far God. It is not a full Far God, or Earth would already be a lost cause, but this Avatar has been casting psychic whispers throughout Witchdom greatly increasing violent tendencies and paranoia turning people against each other.

Note
+ The Factions are at high tension and conflict is escalating between all witches, some may be in all out war with another.
+ The sanest minds are coming to realize something is wrong and cooperate to form joint research operations to discover what is causing this, and to search and destroy.

### Sidebar
You could form teams and talk with factions you would normally be enemies with. Some are more actively hostile, others see the problem and reach out.

### Sidebar
This is certainly not a solo operation, but you’ll want to cooperate with as many others as you can. The Avatar is functionally a “world boss” type threat where the Elder Dragon would be a “Raid boss”. One named Companion from every faction can join you, plus unnamed.

A Secondary Tier Executive has personally requested your assistance as a bodyguard and detective. Their Forecasters have become very uneasy with the unveiling of the Heavenly Palace luxury space station they have constructed in orbit at the Le Lagrange point. Suspected interference suggests an impending Outsider event, provoking a quiet evacuation of non-essential personnel until the situation is cleared. 3 weeks of luxury in, expect the station to resemble Talos 1, from Prey, becoming overrun by increasing aberrations & mimics.

Notes:
+ The station employs stealth fields rendering it invisible outside of a 10 mile sphere.
+ Most your enemies won’t require life support systems.
+/- If the station remains intact and you do good, expect to receive your own penthouse suite onboard.

### Sidebar
The Outsiders mess with the stealth field, causing it to block transportation magics, from broomsticks to portals.

- Slot: Heroic
- Faction: Independent
- Repeatable: True
- Threat: ?
- Conflict: ?
- Reward: 10

Throughout the world there are Dungeons, one for each major Deity who creates the dungeon and sponsors its inhabitants and rewards. Physics and logic completely distinct from reality, per floor. Each floor having its own trials, puzzles, and threats. Size is inconsistent with no continuity between floors. A floor can be anywhere from a broom closet to an entire landscape and the gates to the next floor are hidden behind terms of completion that you may not even know, having to figure it out yourself with or without hints. Dungeons are frequented by witches hoping to reach the top. Few ever do, but you can find witches from any faction competing.

Notes:
+/- Each floor is harder than the last. Receive 1 Reward point every 2nd floor you complete. Take this repeatedly using different quest slots to go further. Up to Floor 50. Folk = 1 floor. Noble = 5, Heroic = 10 floors, Epic = 25 floors. On completing floor 69, get a Wish, as per Consortation.
