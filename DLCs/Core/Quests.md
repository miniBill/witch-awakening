## Quest: Cart Theory
- Slot: Folk
- Evil Route: True
- Threat: 1
- Conflict: 1
- Reward: 1

There is no dire emergency. You are physically capable. Do you accept your duty to return the cart to the pen / deposit, even though you gain nothing?

No one will punish you for not returning the shopping cart, no one will fine you, or kill you for not returning the shopping cart, you gain nothing by returning the shopping cart. You must return the shopping cart out of the goodness of your own heart. You must return the shopping cart because it is the right thing to do. Because it is correct and requires next to no effort.

Are you capable of self-governing?

Notes:
+ There are no short term consequences of this decision.
+ Do you leave a quarter in the lock, undermining the purpose of the locking in favor of feeling like you do helped the next user?
+ Do you sanitize the handlebars before and/or after?
+ Is the wheel particularly squeaky?


## Quest: House Fire
- Slot: Folk
- Evil Route: True
- Threat: 2
- Conflict: 1
- Reward: 2

The house of a non-witch or new low rank witch that you are on friendly terms with, or a relative of, will catch fire into a severe inferno, and you'll be in a position to respond, being within actionable distance and aware of the fire occurring after it kicks off. This fate will prioritize a home that you share with them sometimes, such as if you have roommates or a parents house you sometimes visit and have property stored. This factors any transportation and communication abilities or resources you possess, you could be in another dimension and receive a bad feeling or HexVPN / GhostNet communications that warns you something is wrong.

Notes:
+ Do you evacuate people, pets, and objects?
+ Do you fight the fire by some means? A number of magics could help, chances are it is on Earth, which could limit your actions within the Masquerade. Watchers or ORC will cover up low evidence of magic, like oddities in forensics.

### Sidebar
They cover up evidence in general, it's not a faction issue.

If you're evil, you can instead be fated to cause a house fire that causes the death of someone close to a high status good character, or scarring of someone fully innocent and kind.


## Quest: Domesticated
- Slot: Folk
- Threat: 1
- Conflict: 1
- Reward: 1

Fate will conspire to guarantee that at some point in your life you will have a window of clarity and peace, and situations aligned such that you have a guaranteed opportunity to have a healthy wholesome domestic life at some point, with a home, a partner, and a child that came into your life the old fashioned way or by chance. You'll have up to 20 years of peace, but the peace could begin to fade as early as 6 years in, at your discretion, depending on how much adventure you want to inject into the later years with the child and partner. Your circumstance will align such that you genuinely feel a sense of ease, relaxation, and nothing particularly rough will occur.

Notes:
+ The child and partner are not necessarily a witch themselves. Most witches bear human or non-witch magical race offspring.
+ Human or not, you can still let them know about magic and break the hold of the Veil on them by a number of means.
+ They will have a compatible likable personality.

### Sidebar
If you take House Fire, this synergizes- When your grace period ends, it is your own home that goes ablaze, giving an extra {2} Reward Points.


## Quest: Street Racer
- Slot: Folk
- Threat: 3
- Conflict: 2
- Reward: 3

At some point you somehow find yourself involved with a group of street racers, which as it turns out is a hobby that attracts certain types of witches who appreciate the underground quality to it and I have an affinity for rides, and it's less dangerous when you're semi-immortal beings. Alchemical nitrus potions, firecalling rocket boosts, windkeeping tailwinds, witch races can get wild. On Earth the rules limit to subtle effects, but they tell you about incredible death races off Earth that hold nothing back. Maybe you'll see one some day. For now, you're among very welcoming group of people that love cars and form an extended family.

Notes:
+ You can participate as you wish, as moral support, mechanics, or join the race yourself. If you have Hellrider, you can customize it or integrate it into any other vehicle you get your hands on, but Broomstick speed boosts are restricted to off-earth races.
+ Perhaps a / some of your Companions are in on it


## Quest: Party Animal
- Slot: Folk
- Threat: 1
- Conflict: 2
- Reward: 3

Looks like you have one hell of a party in your fate. Whether it's a major celebration after a more challenging quest of your own or someone else, random occasion, or your own hard work and planning or contribution, you'll at some point attend an amazing party, parade, festival, or otherwise event that will be talked about for decades to come with fond and novel memories, it might even last a whole week. Whether it's some saturnalian festivity of debauched thrills, or a simple meaningful night of karaoke with a small group of friends, it will be a night to remember, and whatever your normal reservations, you'll feel comfortable and at home.

Notes:
+ Design a party of your dreams, small or large.
+ What kinds of memories did you make during it?
+ Did you plan it or help set up? Is it held for you or someone else?
+ Family Friendly, or very much not?
+ Mundane, or Magical in nature? Is it even on Earth?


## Quest: Gone Feral
- Slot: Noble
- Threat: 5
- Conflict: 2
- Reward: 5

Deep in the largest forests on your continent, a tribe of wood elves and dryads have thrived for centuries clinging to their heritage and native ways. However, something is disturbing the local wildlife and is killing their hunters. An ambush by a pack of Dire Wolves went straight for the throat- An intelligent attack that took the lives of their most capable guardians and sages, including their Naturalist Witch matriarch, her soul unable to be reborn, restrained by a foul presence in the Alpha wolf, a soulstealing curse on its fang and claw. Their numbers have gone from numbering in the 100's, to just 34 remaining tribesmen and women. They desperately need help!

Notes:
+ If harmed by the Alpha Dire Wolf, you can't benefit from any means of resurrection or reincarnation, natural or magical.
+ Killing the Alpha or dispelling its curse can free trapped souls.
+ Dire Wolves, while aggressive and violent, aren't usually this malicious, and can't weave a curse like this itself.


## Quest: Just Desserts
- Slot: Noble
- Threat: 6
- Conflict: 4
- Reward: 6

For any number of reasons, you've found yourself at an elaborate dinner party celebrating the wedding between a local princess and a merchant prince known for making his wealth through the cheap mass production of medicines sold at just enough to make a profit, thanks to his usage of Golemwork for automation. They're both beloved by everyone. And yet, in the middle of the dance, they are both struck with a gruesome death. The large estate is sealed off from outside magics and the borders immediately slam shut on lockdown, thick layers of antimagic wards fully enclose the estate.

Until the murderer is caught, every day 1-3 deaths will turn up.

Notes:
+ Each body appears to have a stab wound among other injuries, could it relate to why the souls are missing?
+ The killer must be an Outsider that didn't expect the lockdown, and are trying to cause as much suffering and terror as they can in order to invoke Far Gods to break themselves free.

### Sidebar
The Murderer seems to resist the antimagic fields, and whatever is allowing it, is affecting you too -- but you both effectively have the Dysfunction complication for the quest


## Quest: Ghost Stories
- Slot: Noble
- Threat: 6
- Conflict: 3
- Reward: 5

In a rural town you by some means overhear the hushed terrified whispers that a group of teenagers went searching for two of their missing friend who they claim have fallen victim to the “Witch of the Woods” who cursed the town long ago, every 20 years kids go missing, for the past 200 years. If you check with the factions, nobody has heard of the case. Pulling on the thread yourself however, you'll unravel a town full of supernatural occurrences and come to learn the inhabitants are under some subtle compulsion preventing them from leaving and making outsiders less aware of the town, even from Reapers who'd ferry spirits to safety.

Notes:
+ An isolated ecosystem that's been cut off from Reapers, the inhabitants denied afterlives, left to wander the region until they go insane or fall victim to predatory spirits, evolving into spirit beasts and monsters such as Poltergeists, Banshees, & other dangers that are well fed enough to affect the material world.

### Sidebar
The avoidance compulsion seems strong, however you ended up there, outside help is unlikely. What's going on here?


## Quest: On Silver Wings
- Slot: Noble
- Evil Route: True
- Threat: 5
- Conflict: 3
- Reward: 3

A close friend or family member... or at least a wealthy patron, has been afflicted by a horrific curse causing agony and soulburn. If they succumb to this curse, they face True Death, urgently requiring a specific potion before the next New Moon. The problem is, the potion requires silver blood of a feathered unicorn, creatures of divine grace, light, and purity -- and extraordinarily rare, unlikely to even appear on Earth. You must enter the Faewilds and seek out the unicorn and obtain its blood. The intelligent creature cannot tolerate evil or corruption and is equivalent to a Rank 5 class Witch in raw magic potential utilizing light based magics.

Notes:
+ If you can be considered “Good” aligned and unselfish, the unicorn can be bargained with to willingly give a vial of silverblood
+ If you also have a female form without male aspects, the unicorn may be more friendly, even loving, and give silverblood in exchange for your time, and becomes an ally.

### Sidebar
If you kill the unicorn, you obtain a treasure trove of very rare potion / ritual ingredients, and the horn can improve any Rod or wand to increase magical potency by 10%.

### Sidebar
As an ally, the unicorn can provide silverblood in the future, feathers, and come to your aid in times of great need. Otherwise is good company when you visit.


## Quest: On my Mark
- Slot: Noble
- Threat: 4
- Conflict: 6
- Reward: 4

You've received either a bounty tip or an assassination mark for a wanted rogue witch, or a nosy witch who stuck their nose in the wrong person's business or were in the wrong place at the wrong time. They're wanted dead or alive either way. If you take them alive, the Threat and Reward both increase by 2 points as they resist. They'll have at least two tier 4 magics, plus a random assortment of 1-3 rank magics, making them an either an experienced and capable witch, or a naturally gifted witch in over their head. They have allies of similar standard to your own, being a member of a major faction with a companion from that faction.

Notes:
+ If evil, the client prefers them alive and roughed up a little.
+ If good, the ORC or Watchers hosting the bounty don't have a preference for alive or dead, but will find any prisoner abuse distasteful or potentially criminal, but they're wanted for some serious reason, such as burning an orphanage.


## Quest: The Mathematician
- Slot: Heroic
- Threat: 7
- Conflict: 4
- Reward: 7

A form of magic that pops up from time to time. By nature it's hard to describe, but to be brief; High Order Mathematics is a very raw form of magic that unfailingly renders the practitioner insane, not from unnatural memetic hazards, but the raw understanding and changes in perspective utilizing numerals and characters of the First Language used in Runes, The Mathematician is an insane witch, but a glimpse in their mind is like looking upon a Far God -- chaotic, esoteric, unpredictable. The Mathematician is capable of replicating any magic effect, and many unknown magic effects, but is thoroughly insane- And for some reason, they've fixated on you.

Notes:
+ They aren't malicious, but in their fixation they're experimenting on you with any number of parameters. They want -- need -- to know everything about you, remaining distant but engineering scenarios that test some quality or attribute of yours, even as simple as “How do they react to becoming a cat” -- or much worse.

### Sidebar
To be clear, the Mathematician is an insane stalker, who is one of the most powerful non-deities in the setting, & highly paranoid, almost never in-person.

### Sidebar
They aren't an ally, and observe you remotely. They make your life more interesting and hazardous, but might intervene to save you from True Death, but not hardships, until bored.


## Quest: Pack Tactics
- Slot: Heroic
- Threat: 8
- Conflict: 3
- Reward: 7

Requires *Gone Feral*. You track down the source of the soulstealing curse within the dire wolves, leading you to discover that the pack of dire wolves are just an offshoot from the greater Lycanthrope packs that are currently embroiled in a blood feud. Werewolves Hulking hominid beasts between 8 and 12ft in height full of tense muscle. Immune to damage except from silver weapons, or Golden Relics, with strength sufficient to crush through concrete walls and shred steel plating like paper, or hurling an elephant across a football field. They are all overwhelmed by bloodlust currently, with the Soulstealer curse, as feral as though it were a full moon.

Notes:
+ They can leap hundreds of meters in height and distance
+ Their movements in straight lines are a blur.
+ Luckily for you, their violence is primarily concentrated on each other -- A war of succession seems to be going on.
+ 8+ werewolves, 2 alphas, dozens of direwolves.

### Sidebar
If you survive a werewolf bite, you become a werewolf yourself. Werewolves do not have conscious thought in werewolf form, and are forced to transform on full moons.

### Sidebar
It takes decades to gain self-mastery sufficient to force a conscious change, starting out at a few minutes at a time before changing back or losing control.


## Quest: Death Racer
- Slot: Heroic
- Threat: 7
- Conflict: 5
- Reward: 8

Requires *Street Racer*. You're in the big leagues now. Once every 5 years the Death Race is hosted in a random location anywhere off Earth and there are no limits placed on magic usage, barring only soulstealing or curses that lasts beyond the duration of the race. The caveat is that all participants are hooked up into limiters that regulate mana capacity and mana flow. Instead, you have a series of pellets honed to allow the usage of one magic effect of a given rank. You have 1 Ruby pellet (r5), 3 Sapphire pellets (r4), 9 Emerald pellets (r3), and 20 Citrine pellets (r2), r1 magic is unlimited. Any augmentations to your vehicle is separate & functions normally.

Notes:
+ Tactics vary from witches that put everything they've got into speed, while some focus on making sure nothing else is alive to cross the finish line before them.
+ Races are designed to require an average time of 2+ hours before the 1st place gets claimed.

### Sidebar
If you are not a racer, racers can have “support crew” they can call in for service or support up to 3 times per day for up to an hour per stay, having only 1 of each pellet per visit.

### Sidebar
The racer can lend support crew their own pellets for use, if needed. Support crew can bring items with them, even leaving relics behind. Also, food and water.


## Quest: Broken Point
- Slot: Heroic
- Threat: 7
- Conflict: 4
- Reward: 7

A clan of intelligent giant albino elks are calling in favors to seek help, a wild rift has ripped open in their territory and alien creatures roam through to hunt the elk down and drag them back through the rift. While fairly strong with some innate magic of their own, they prove no match for the creatures. They need to put an end to it. Next time the rift opens, fight the creatures back and enter to find an exotic plane consisting entirely of biomatter with fleshy earth, boney spires arching through the sky, teeming with fleshy equivalents to plantlife forming jungles, as far as you know this plane is unknown to witchdom and unexplored.

Notes:
+ How are these creatures (of your description) opening rifts? Spontaneous evolution, their own intelligent pursuit of magical knowledge? or random chance opening a natural wild rift?
+ Perhaps there are survivors that were taken for some other reason, or simply not yet killed / eaten.


## Quest: Necropolis
- Slot: Heroic
- Threat: 9
- Conflict: 3
- Reward: 8

An ancient lich thought to be defeated with the destruction of their phylactery has been busy for 600 years. Stray rumors over the years occasionally being investigated with no evidence. Beneath Himalayas the lich founded a new lair and has employed spatial distortion and Domain magics to convert the bottom of a deep cave system into a veritable hollow earth greater in size than Hawthorne's metropolis- Populated entirely of countless undead. Evidently keeping “livestock” including humans in their main palace sustained by magic to keep creating new life to utilize their skeletons in death. A city carved of stone and built up in bone.

Notes:
+ A Rank 6 tier necromancer skilled in potions, runes, earthmoving, dominion, witchery, and familiarity with a bone dragon familiar.
+ Very stealthily abducts new creatures & humans sometimes.
+ Intends to initiate full scale war on humanity once built up enough to risk breaking the Masquerade.

### Sidebar
The situation could easily devolve to be worth an Epic quest if you make a mistake, but the number of possible outcomes keep this as a Heroic quest instead.

### Sidebar
Bear in mind the dangers of necromancers' ability to trap souls.


## Quest: Tainted Grail
- Slot: Epic
- Evil Route: True
- Threat: 9
- Conflict: 6
- Reward: 8

If you have the Nymph's Vessel, you'll notice its waters running red one day: Something terrible has happened at the Baths of the Nymphs. A Hespatian family has broken through their wards and massacred the nymphs, butchering the women in their waters, staining them red and have stolen the Holy Grail, the golden relic 29, and used this act of bloodshed to corrupt it into a twisted opposite of itself. Contact with its waters is an absolute poison and causes an instant transition to undeath moving in a wave over the still living victim's body. Living flesh within a mile of the grail sickens and begins to turn black.

Notes:
+ You must hunt down the invaders and find a way to restore the grail and restore its place in the Central Fountain, bringing the Baths back to life, and the bodies of the nymphs within.
+ The Nymphs are the primary distributor of the components for healing potions, there will be a major shortage.

### Sidebar
The nymphs will be very thankful and give you free access to the baths. A villain may instead claim the tainted grail for themselves, damning the Nymphs and forever creating a major disruption to the availability of healing potions.

### Sidebar
Be careful with what you do with the grail... If you lost it in the ocean it could slowly poison all waters on Earth causing rampant undead outbreaks, and all the gods will stand in judgment of you with fates worse than death.


## Quest: Dragon Hunt
- Slot: Epic
- Threat: 10
- Conflict: 4
- Reward: 10

Elder Dragons are apocalyptic beasts. They are to dragons what dragons are to riding drakes. The size of a literal mountain, Elder Dragons were banished from Earth by the gods and archangels, early on before the Great Flood. There's 5 in the solar system currently, one on Mercury, Venus, Titan, Europa, and Pluto. 1+ others are known to have left the solar system, and there are a few dozen known to be scattered through the realms and elemental planes. They share the statistics of a dragon as seen in Metamorphosis, but are scaled up by a thousand and are intelligent, utilizing Relics from their hoard to work magic effects.

Notes:
+ Pick a location of your choice, for some reason the Elder Dragon of choice has become agitated and active, lashing out and if it's in the solar system, its roars are being picked up on human scientific equipment. It needs to be silenced one way or another.
+ Nothing escapes and Elder Dragon bite, not even spirits.


## Quest: Sanguine Light
- Slot: Epic
- Threat: 9
- Conflict: 5
- Reward: 6

You've run afoul of an ancient Vampire Lord through some means, from insult or challenge, or your actions against their clan. They are a high level Hespatian with a family that oversees other families, and is the same vampire that turned the Red Mother. A Vampire Lord is almost as strong as a Werewolf and half as fast, but with more agility, keeping speed with fine movements or focusing to execute preplanned movements that seem like teleportation. They are powerful magic users capable of Necromancy without being a witch, and effectively have the Blood Witch perk. They regenerate from harm so long as one undying cell is intact.

Notes:
+ This Vampire Lord IS in fact a witch as well. Their magics are boosted by 100% so long as they're well-fed (1 cup a day, decays over 3 days to 0%). Sunlight reduces all magic potency by -75%, along with strength, speed, and regeneration. Garlic is just pungent. Running water burns as a nuisance.

### Sidebar
Holy Symbols just make them uncomfortable. A Vampire is a self-animated corpse that feeds on spirit traces in living blood to sustain their own amalgam spirit. It is not the same person as it was in life - unless an Empusa, or Necromancy is employed to rebind the spirit back to the same body to bypass the change, allowing a true conversion. If bitten and die, you become a normal vampire (See Immortal Blood Vol.), unless you slay and drink a Lord's blood to become one yourself.


## Quest: Mad Bomber
- Slot: Epic
- Threat: 7
- Conflict: 10
- Reward: 6

A crazed explosion witch initiated a terrorist plot and severely violated the Masquerade. With careful planning and skillfully avoiding divination and probability engines, was able to simultaneously bomb 27 cities. On Earth, and seemed to deliberately make sure that each “bomb” destroyed assets of powerful magical beings and witches of each major faction, popular Gateway networks, and so on. And they did so under your name, wearing your face (or your most used face). With a severe Masquerade violation, the gods are involved, with Rank 10 equivalent magics, time is completely stopped, a world in stasis.

Notes:
+ Celestial and Infernal agents of gods and high level Faction leaders are combing the streets and employing a form of domain bubble capable of rewinding local time to peer into the past and live, as though present, to seek answers. You are freed from stasis for questioning and to contribute to the investigation.

### Sidebar
Explore a world frozen in time and use the temporary power granted to you to walk the past to uncover what happened, why, and who did this, as you work with angels, demons, and faction leaders to resolve the situation and rebuild before humanity wakes.

### Sidebar
Tensions will remain high and you'll remain under observation the entire time, after an intense period of questioning and initial detainment. It can be dangerous if you play your cards poorly, you can only imagine what it'd be like if you actually broke the Masquerade... I mean, you didn't do it... right? You believe so...


## Quest: Deep Whispers
- Slot: Epic
- Threat: 10
- Conflict: 10
- Reward: 10

A cult of Outsiders to a particular Far God have succeeded in creating a corrupted Domain around an entire city of your choice outside of Europe, China, America, or Japan. They've filled that city with waking nightmares and unspeakable crimes for a 1 month period shielded from the eyes of the divine and Godsight Array satellites.. They have managed to tear rifts in the aether sufficient to have invoked the Avatar of a Far God. It is not a full Far God, or Earth would already be a lost cause, but this Avatar has been casting psychic whispers throughout Witchdom greatly increasing violent tendencies and paranoia turning people against each other.

Note
+ The Factions are at high tension and conflict is escalating between all witches, some may be in all out war with another.
+ The sanest minds are coming to realize something is wrong and cooperate to form joint research operations to discover what is causing this, and to search and destroy.

### Sidebar
You could form teams and talk with factions you would normally be enemies with. Some are more actively hostile, others see the problem and reach out.

### Sidebar
This is certainly not a solo operation, but you'll want to cooperate with as many others as you can. The Avatar is functionally a “world boss” type threat where the Elder Dragon would be a “Raid boss”. One named Companion from every faction can join you, plus unnamed.

A Secondary Tier Executive has personally requested your assistance as a bodyguard and detective. Their Forecasters have become very uneasy with the unveiling of the Heavenly Palace luxury space station they have constructed in orbit at the Le Lagrange point. Suspected interference suggests an impending Outsider event, provoking a quiet evacuation of non-essential personnel until the situation is cleared. 3 weeks of luxury in, expect the station to resemble Talos 1, from Prey, becoming overrun by increasing aberrations & mimics.

Notes:
+ The station employs stealth fields rendering it invisible outside of a 10 mile sphere.
+ Most your enemies won't require life support systems.
+/- If the station remains intact and you do good, expect to receive your own penthouse suite onboard.

The Outsiders mess with the stealth field, causing it to block transportation magics, from broomsticks to portals.


## Quest: Dungeoneering
- Slot: Heroic
- Faction: Independent
- Repeatable: True
- Threat: ?
- Conflict: ?
- Reward: 10

Throughout the world there are Dungeons, one for each major Deity who creates the dungeon and sponsors its inhabitants and rewards. Physics and logic completely distinct from reality, per floor. Each floor having its own trials, puzzles, and threats. Size is inconsistent with no continuity between floors. A floor can be anywhere from a broom closet to an entire landscape and the gates to the next floor are hidden behind terms of completion that you may not even know, having to figure it out yourself with or without hints. Dungeons are frequented by witches hoping to reach the top. Few ever do, but you can find witches from any faction competing.

Notes:
+/- Each floor is harder than the last. Receive 1 Reward point every 2nd floor you complete. Take this repeatedly using different quest slots to go further. Up to Floor 50. Folk = 1 floor. Noble = 5, Heroic = 10 floors, Epic = 25 floors. On completing floor 69, get a Wish, as per Consortation.

ADVENTURE TIME
Folk

Threat 1
Conflict 1
Reward 1

What are the chances. One moment you're at home or some equivalent, perfectly content sipping your favorite drink and in a sudden instance of abrupt chaos you're thrown like a car crash and twisted through a Wild Rift to some unknown land where three moons streak across the sky illuminated by binary stars.

There is no sign of civilization, just rich nature and crisp air.

As for life, it appears that predation was never evolved in this world, neither are there harmful bacteria, parasites, fungus, or viruses. All creatures found in this place are friendly with complex social evolution and methods of nonverbal communication

Notes:
+A very safe world with no natural threats other than accidents.
+ All life appears to actively try to help other lifeforms, even the plants will bend to shelter you from the rain, vines may creep up to stem your bleeding, fluffy critters will bring you help.
+ You'll find a way out after 3y, unless you have Portals.


SPECIAL DELIVERY
Folk

Threat 1
Conflict 1
Reward 1

You've received a job by some means, where you're given a shipment of deliveries that need to be made before the big night on Halloween, delivering packages and parcels of items that are important to the would-be recipients. Perhaps even the good Stork got one of his bundles mixed up into your delivery basket. Otherwise all the items are low tier magical items with strange enchantments that are not beneficial to combat in any way, mostly being novelties related to Halloween from candy snakes to mood setting jack-o-lanterns or candles, and abnormal candies with exotic flavors special to the supernatural world of Witchdom.

Notes:
+ Pays your body weight in fantastical mystery candies.
+ Each delivery target may be a fun eccentric character to interact with, and may have good tips or become useful contacts.
+ In your reward is an oddly shaped and worded invitation to Halloween Town.

SIGHTSEEING
Folk

Threat 1
Conflict 1
Reward 1

You're new in town, likely fresh off of your witch awakening and now being shown the ropes in the area your primary faction sets up shop, or perhaps you're just taking a tourist stop at some other new location on or off earth. After all, you can probably now go anywhere you want on Earth now with little effort through the gates of other witches’ established travel networks, an ally that can take you somewhere, or just venturing off on your own by broomstick or ride. Whatever the case, you have some time to kill absorbing the sights of the world with new eyes, and maybe you'll meet some friends along the way.

Notes:
+ Not inherently dangerous, but by your own choices you might run into trouble, from visiting shady back alley streets or getting caught up in the affairs of a supernatural entity.
+ You can explore on your own of course, but this quest guarantees the opportunity for up to 2/y in total.

DREAM TRIAL
Folk

Threat 2
Conflict 3
Reward 1

At some point you'll catch the attention of someone or something that takes an interest in you, benevolent or malevolent, but nonetheless somewhat intrusive -- They'll render you unconscious via a spiritual or physical means of inducing sleep. Whatever they wanted with you, you'll experience an exotic surreal dream wherein you will confront a series of trials or one greater trial, trials that reveal various character flaws about yourself. Things you on some level know could be better, or that you shouldn't do, or secret desires you avoid facing. The perpetrator may or may not be involved with the dream, or it may be a side effect of something else.

Notes:
+ Whatever the perpetrators intentions, this quest is guaranteed to cause no lasting harm or endanger your life. Whatever they wanted would be satisfied or interrupted without escalation unless you chain this quest into a more serious quest.
+ The trials can help overcome mental hangups.

PINCH OF STARDUST
Folk

Threat 1
Conflict 1
Reward 1

You've come into possession of an interesting recipe book of alchemical cooking, giving recipes for various potions in food forms. One recipe in particular catches your eye that appears to describe a process by which to distill starlight into usable stardust.

Naturally the only reasonable course of action is to go attempt to follow the recipe by going out before dawn and focusing starlight into one point, and then letting the rays of the rising sun crystalize the captive rays into twinkling grains of stardust.

It might take a few nights, you only get one shot every morning to attempt it, but seeing the handful of stardust will be satisfying.

Notes:
+ Stardust is beautiful, like powdered gemstones that always sparkle just right.
+ Stardust can be used as an alchemical ingredient sufficient for potions up to rank 3, or a minor ingredient in others.
+ Can be converted into 50 Kisses or sold for 1-200.
+ Starlight refining is now a skill you have to make use of any morning you wish.


## INTRODUCTIONS
- Slot: Folk
- Evil Route: True

Threat 1
Conflict 1
Reward 1

It's only natural for a new witch to attract the attention of other witches in the area. Wherever you end up settling down for some length of time or visit an area after having made some name for yourself already, you'll receive an invite or by chance get include in on a meeting between a handful of regional witches either to just have a conversation to get a feel for you, to introduce themselves, or perhaps it was for some minor event they already had planned anyway and will bring you in on. Perhaps this is where you'll meet one or more of your future Companions, or maybe you'll never see these people again after a potentially rambunctious night.

Notes:
+ If used towards companions, the Reward for this quest amounts 4RP instead of 1. If you use this opportunity on a free companion instead, you can raise their Sociability or Teamwork +1
+ What the gathering entails is up to you so long as it makes sense for those involved, and the low threat /conflict.
+ You might use this opportunity to get into mischief.

## SPOOKY STORIES
- Slot: Folk
- Evil Route: True

Threat 1
Conflict 1
Reward 1

You, alone or with friends, decided it was a great idea to spend a particular rainy night listening to, telling, or watching spooky stories. As you part ways for the night to go off to your own rooms or your own homes, or otherwise wind down for the night, everyone finds themselves on edge with goosebumps and thoughts of the stories shared or movies watched earlier that night. The night will be beset by a host of spooky phenomenon made more spooky by your understanding as a witch that things like ghosts and other monsters ARE in fact, very real and you might see one now where you wouldn't have been able to before!

Notes:
+ No matter how terrifying it can get, no harm will come to anyone.
+ How the spooks occur is entirely up to you, perhaps there really is a monster under the bed! Perhaps a poltergeist watched the movie with you and decided to pull pranks, or just one of the friends did. Perhaps it was all mundane tricks?
+ Perhaps YOU are the one pranking others! Your companions or associates might have words for you later though.

## LAUNDRY DAY
- Slot: Folk
- Evil Route: True

Threat 1
Conflict 1
Reward 1

Well then. That stain isn't coming off any time soon You somehow ran afoul of a gang of gremlins and leprechauns, who pulled a prank(s) on you that culminated in every article of clothing you own, including your own witch garments no less, stained with a curse of distress leading to any number of potential mishaps where they end up stained torn or outright disappearing right off your back The curse requires a specialist you're referred to who runs a laundromat for mortals and witches a like with a special Kiss coin slot normally hidden by the veil that activates the curse cleansing cycle, with that fresh newly blessed scent.

Notes:
+ You might think of other means to remove curses, but whatever the scenario this will end up the most practical option easy at hand.
+ Side quest: Leprechauns are lecherous bastards and may have taken inappropriate photos of you or others you become aware and have to track down for an extra 2rp
+ Maybe you instead cut a deal with the leprechaun and instead sell more pictures as the means to get that 2 extra rp, etc.

DISCOUNT GOODS
Folk

Threat 2
Conflict 2
Reward 1

On the lookout for a place to buy some goods, you find a bit of a run down establishment with a veiled sign out front displaying a different message for witches, and an internal domain means you enter a separate space than what a human would. The witch running the store is having some money troubles and needs to push sales quick, so she’s offering everything at half off and may add in a favor or two in the process. You can use this shop this one time to buy any Ingredients, Potions, Runes, or Relics priced at less than 6p, all at half price up to a total discount of no more than 25,000 Kiss equivalent, or no more than 3rp off arelic. Can do both K and rp.

Notes:
+ Note that potion sales are typically 50-200% more expensive than the listed base price shown in the magics, as that's the creation cost.
+ She possesses Ritual Inks, and can use them to tattoo you with runes without buying the Ritual Ink relic yourself.
+ Good candidate for a Custom companion?

FREE MEDICAL
Folk

Threat 1
Conflict 2
Reward 1

This quest is a little bit of job security. At some point in the future you'll be severely injured as the result of something, likely some higher ranked quest, but this quest ensures you'll have an encounter where your medical needs will be provided for you free of charge, perhaps with an associated service or favor that might chain to another quest later, or perhaps they simply have ulterior motives. For example: This could be the classic scenario where someone is defeated only to be rescued by a stranger and then treated in a strange environment or safehouse, tended to until back in shape enough to go challenge the boss or monster again.

Notes:
+ This can also be used as a one time life saver to ensure that though you'll lose, you'll survive one encounter that may have killed you (And not have to risk cheating death, or Free Medical ensures your means of cheating death works and is taken, of, like making sure your Draviri egg hatches, ect.)

### Sidebar
Interaction: You can use this to claim the rewards of a quest early, and use this recovery period as the opportunity to spend it, and return with advantage

## THE SWIMSUIT EPISODE
- Slot: Folk
- Evil Route: True

Threat 2
Conflict 1
Reward 1

Anyone can just go to the beach or the pool, but with this quest you're ensured for an extra special trip to some manner of swimsuit event, or you could integrate this quest with another to transform that quest into a swimsuit episode by some means, where events are orchestrated such that the other quest occurs with everyone still in their swimsuits. Taken on its own however, it means it won't just be a normal day in the water but will incorporate any and all the tropes you think make up the ideal swimsuit episode in how it affects others as well as yourself, in light hearted ways. Functionally distinct from “Hot Springs” as hot springs focus on relaxing.

Notes:
+ Everyone involved will permanently gain their ideal swimsuit as a form their Garment can take when summoned.
+ Can take you to any water park or beach location you can think of, provided there are no lasting supernatural benefits.
+ You control the ESRB rating, so to speak.

## TEA PARTY
- Slot: Folk
- Evil Route: True

Threat 2
Conflict 2
Reward 1

By some means you'll be invited to a particular tea party, a private affair or a part of a larger event. It could be serious, like a precursor to Courtship, Just Desserts, or meeting the mark of On My Mark, or perhaps it's just a light hearted novelty and moment of reprieve. The tea party is one that makes good use of the fact that the attendants are witches. Every dish will in some way be magical, though only the main course will have lasting effects that extend beyond the next morning. The Main Course will be a single use consumable that you eat or drink there at the party that can carry the benefits of any one Potion from Alchemy.

Notes:
+ This includes rank 5 potions. Drink or consume an Arch-Curative in the form of a cake that fully rejuvenates your body, grant you agelessness if you lacked it, or perhaps you were roofied with a Love Potion? Did a True-shape potion replace your race with that of another? Wake up a Mimi? A Doll?

MOONLIT SERENADE
Noble

Threat 3
Conflict 4
Reward 3

A fated chance encounter or a moment that makes you and one other see each other in a new light, and you will feel the spark of love, mutual, leading to a romantic night. How far exactly that goes is up to your discretion, but it won't be a casual choice not to pursue it further as you will feel actual love and a connection, so make sure there's some actual reason why the relationship won't advance further, if you intend to try to keep it to a one-night stand. It won't be all fun and games, there may be some minor quarreling with past rivals, exes, or some the event experiences an interruption at some point at any spot in the timeline, perhaps it's how you meet.

Notes:
+ This can target a companion that can reasonably be attracted to you. Sexuality is usually glossed over, so mostly free reign.
+ Can pair well with Courtship to ensure a meeting goes well, if you're one of the parties involved in the proposition.
+ Grants 3 more RP if it leads into Domesticated.

YES TEACHER!
Noble

Threat 4
Conflict 5
Reward 3

Requires Summer School perk. One of your teachers at summer school proved to be an exceptional teacher and a master of both the subject, and teaching. Or maybe you were just enthralled by them, you found yourself respecting them or possibly looking up to them. Whatever the case, you valued their teachings more, as well as them as a person, and they were able to teach you more. It's not without its consequences however, for you face a rival in monopolizing the teacher's time: The Teacher's Pet, The Class Rep, The Delinquent, and The Bully will all compete in a social and/or literal free-for-all, and Teacher's lessons will be extra rough!

Notes:
+ You can select the teacher for any options that would allow you to select a friend, and choose a second School Trip.
+ The subject they taught instead increases to 4, rather than 3, and you can buy the remaining rank as though it had the faction discount applied. (Stacking 50% off).

LATE FEES
Noble

Threat 3
Conflict 5
Reward 2

A librarian, perhaps one from the companion's section, has requested some help in tracking down 6 particular books that are well past overdue. You will have to track down the culprits in everyone's favorite fetch quest, where each culprit has some tangental problem that conveniently needs to be solved before they're able to hand over the book and the late fee before you're off to the next Perhaps one book was swiped away by a thieving gremlin, while another fell out of their bookbag in the middle of a broomflight across Arcadia. Perhaps one was lost in the cargo of a sunken ship.

Notes:
+ If you write at least a sentence in your build for each book's own particular predicament, you can gain an extra 3rp.
+ Either way, you can also gain increased library privileges that help you study, train, or learn insights to gain more more favor, increasing your Focus/Might/Favor progress 2x for 1y.

VITAL LOTUS
Noble - Evil Route

Threat 6
Conflict 4
Reward 3

In your travels or maybe simply your daily routine, you cross paths with a traveling witch. Circumstance will be such that she'll let slip that she's searching for the Flower of Life. Typical witchdom antics, not much to dwell on. You'll happen to see her 3 months later with a missing arm and a half mask covering her scarred left side and significantly less spirit in her remaining eye. Compelled to inquire, you'd learn that she's the only surviving member of a band of adventurers that found the flower, but were intercepted by a cult of hespatian necromancers that burned the field and fled with the last 6 that may ever exist. Are you up to tracking them down?

Notes:
+ There will be a large force of undead and Necromancers of ranks 2-+ among various tricks and other magics of your adding.
+ If you give her a flower, she'll become a Lifeweaver with the following card if taken as a companion: Xiao Liena | [TODO]
+ Use one to learn Lifeweaving with rp: LIFEWEAVING
+ You could instead opt to join the Necromancers, who sought to burn the Flowers of Life to prevent the spread of Lifeweaving. Lifeweaving will be barred from your timeline with few practitioners in the world, and in her failure and having lead to the destruction of the grove of flowers, Liena will take her own life. Actual reward for this path? Well, if you're a Hespatian you might dominate the necromancers, and take control of their Family, becoming your grunts.

DISTRESS BEACON
Noble

Threat 6
Conflict 4
Reward 4

Requires Lunabella, Alphazon, ORC, HexVPN, OR Battleship. In short, some means to receive space coms personally or as a mission from a higher up who received it. At some point in time sensors, tech or magical, pick up on an unknown object streaking through the solar system from beyond the oort cloud heading through on a trajectory straight to the sun. A Ghost or HexNet (or both) broadcast is repeating a distress signal on repeat requesting help in a quickly deciphered strange language spoken in a feminine voice To the point, a space ship is on collision course with the sun and being pursued by a space kraken, naturally you'll need to step in.

Notes:
+ The Space Kraken behaves like a Hydra, with its tentacles.
+ Space Kraken is accompanied by a swarm of attack babies ranging from face huggers to large octopi, and a few colossal squids in sizes.
+ Space Kraken itself, is comparable to a battleship.
+ The person is a witch - from outside the solar system.
+ The space witch has been on a 60y journey from her home star on a vessel built with early space age equivalent tech improved upon with magic. The interiors are however, quite spacious due to spatial warping and dominion class magic providing gravity. It's more like a yacht inside.

FAMILIAR TROUBLE
Noble - Evil Route

Threat 5
Conflict 4
Reward 6

For whatever reason, business or interests have taken you to Alfheimr, the faewild. While there you run into a chance encounter with an abnormally fluffy corgi-inu that tries to get your attention with a particular spark of intellect in its eyes. Occasionally growling in the direction it tries to lead you before returning to being adorable. It will lead you through a series of minor trials, nothing for a witch such as yourself, and end with an encounter with a large beast. In the vicinity of the beast you'll find the dead body of a witch of a type that has a death cheat that requires a bit of care to make sure it works successfully, such as a draviri egg.

Notes:
+ The corgi-inu is familiar to the dead witch.
+ Once the dust settles, the corgi-inu whines next to their witch's remains or the cheat death focal item, and stares at you with huge begging eyes. The corgi-inu will slowly vanish over time, or instantly if the cheat death object is destroyed.
+ There's an obvious bad route where you do not save the dead witch, leaving the corgi-inu to fade, or destroying the witch's means of cheating death or making it implausible, in which case the corgi-inu dies. Or a worse path may involve abducting the vulnerable witch.

HALLOWEEN TOWN
Heroic - Evil Route

Threat 8
Conflict 4
Reward 4

Requires Special Delivery. Halloween Town is a semi-secret location in its own realm, where it is halloween every day with a Novelty enchantment ensuring that anything you see for the first time here, will always feel as novel as that first time. Everyone is always in some manner of costume and everyone lives openly to celebrate their different races of witch, and non-witch supernaturals. However, your visit comes at an inopportune moment, as Halloween Town is under threat from the Skeleton King who recently usurped the Pumpkin King as owner of the private realm, and is subjecting the citizens to tyrannical laws via Covenant and Dominion magics.

Notes:
+ The Skeleton King may mind control citizens to use against you.
+ Succeed, and the Pumpkin King will bless you with an encounter with the Pumpkin Moon: Pumpkin Boons. https://imgur.com/a/R8aMfTp taking only MARKED boons. The Deal wish is the same Consortation 5 but service as an Entity instead.

With, if you don't mind the meta elements, a selection of six Pumpkin Boons for himself, tweaked in various ways as to not technically be the same boons, as the entities he pacted with in the past have finished their terms. As a reward. Skeleton will enslave Pumpkin to you with a slave crest, which may also change his sex if you prefer.

SPACE TENTACLES
Heroic - Evil Route

Threat 9
Conflict 4
Reward 7

Requires Distress Beacon. So you killed the space kraken and saved the strange witch. The dust was starting to settle and maybe you've had one or a few conversations with the witch calling herself Sara Star through her translator. She's often seen working on repairing her ship, Red Betty, but no more than 1 week later you get the call. Those in the know have been watching the direction Sara came from, and it just paid off as we've noticed a fleet of entities entering the system from the same spot as Sara & her space tentacle friends. Sara's ship might be done in time to help towards the end, but for now a team of witches including yourself will intercept.

Notes:
+ Invaders will be composed of 1 mothership (Space Leviathan), 4 space krakens, and a dozen swarms of space squid, with countless face hugging octopi that are more like projectiles than fighters.
+ If you succeed and she survives, gain Sara Star as a possible companion. Sara Star

TIME SLIP
Epic (Arcadia)

Threat 9
Conflict 2
Reward 4

The Arcadian Parks & Recreation board were toying with temporal distribution to figure out ways to adjust local time dilation within their environmental changes to the system which could have huge benefits to social and practical life in Arcadia. Problem is, a bit of code from those experiments somehow slipped into the live update and the result sent you and all your companions flying through spacetime. You were the closest to the proper timeline, so the P&R. team was able to make contact with you and attribute you with an anchor pin allowing you to dive deeper to find each of your companions, stuck in various points in time.

Notes:
+ You and each companion will only keep 1 magic at a max of rank 3
+ Every time you find a companion, you'll need to find Extraction, sending that companion home and you to the next timeline.

+ Increase the reward by 2 RP for each Companion you have. When finished with the quest and you return to your time, each companion will be waiting for you, only having 1 minute intervals between when each reappeared, less than 30 min since you all vanished.

Conflict 9
Reward 6

Hawthorne is running a special event established by the First Witch founder of the academy. Only the top 5 best students are allowed to participate, each will undergo a ritual that sends them to a different aetheric sphere- the same that the First Witch came from at the founding of Hawthorne.

During which time you'll go through 10 years of conflict and hardships. If you have Laura or Hannah as companions, they might qualify as well, and join you as allies within. https://imgur.com/a/nC89lbq

MAIDEN TRAIN
Noble (Watchers) - Evil Route

Threat 5
Conflict 4
Reward 6

There is a special train that runs across either North America, Europe, Siberia, or the left coast of South America through Chile and Argentina. It's a scenic route taken by the train once every 4 years for blocks of youth from one All Girls christian jewish, or islamic school to another as part of a coming of age ceremony. The train and its tracks are hidden by the veil, but these precessions are often the target of terroristic (at best) acts, considered a high prize job in disreputable circles. You are tasked as a Watcher or hired along with Watchers if you've earned their trust, to chaperone the train and ensure it's safe travels. In the meantime, enjoy the views.

Notes:
+ The train takes a highly scenic route full of great views.
+ Most the girls are witches themselves, though of limited effect.
+ The train will be attacked at one point by Hespatians or Outsiders, acting on their own with a few allies to make a name for themselves & enjoy the would-be spoils of the job.

BLOODSTONE CHALICE
Noble (Hespatia) - Evil
 
Threat 3
Conflict 7
Reward 3

The Family of Red Mother and the Family of Whisper are known to collaborate on a ritual where they meet at a heretical site containing the bloodstone chalice, a unique relic, where they hold a ritual orgy and mass sacrifice, the resulting fluids being channeled through blood grooves throughout the chamber and concentrated into the chalice. 200 lives will participate in the event, 100 being sacrificed at the end. All participants will feel a sense of euphoria that lasts a week, while the 5 designated to take a drink will permanently unlock the potential to learn Visceramancy and in the moment of drinking choose to replace their witch race with another.

Notes:

Threat 1
Conflict 1
Reward 3

You're in space, on the moon, here in Lunabella. Why didn't you think of it sooner? Time to go stargazing, which on Lunabella can include looking up at the Earth through a telescope. Go outside of a Domain bubble if you want to view the sky without any atmosphere in the way. Maybe it's a romantic idea to try to get closer to one of your companions and you'll enjoy some candle light with your picnic basket somewhere in the Sea of Tranquility or maybe you just want to soak in the silence of the airless landscape beyond the domains. Bringing back a moon rock is fine too.

Notes:
+ You can add a high power magic enhanced telescope to your inventory if you wish, capable of looking at the Earth with enough zoom to make out city streets or get a good eye full of Saturn's rings. No I didn't actually check the math on that.
+ You can enchant your clothes with moondust repellant.
+ Or you can take that telescope and go be a voyeur. You do you. Probably less romantic if you still want to get closer to a companion with this quest.

FAERIE KING'S COURT
Epic (Alliance) - Evil Route

It's been many hundreds of years since the current order of Alfheimr was established, with the ousting of the majority of the Archfae who ruled the faewilds in the times past, the surviving Archfae being those to have established the contract where they'll support the transition of power to see their old rivals downed. An Archfae rivals a Greater Demon in might and potential, and one has just returned from oblivion. Spontaneous regenesis of its own existence. Once one of the nicer lords of the realm known as the Prince of Petals, he's come back as the Lord of Thorns, with a score to settle.

You know, provided you and those you bring with you are cool with outsiders. And tentacles. Lots. of. tentacles, served with a side of tentacles. Some tendrils thrown in just to spice it up a bit, and in more varieties than you can dream up.

Conflict 2
Reward 2

A very simple and straightforward matter. A district in Deco City, ORC's city, or some other supernatural aware civilized community, is currently short on staff to manage some necessities and basic community care. So, the ORC has issued a request for available agents and general staff to volunteer for various public service roles, temporarily of course. Could last a few days, or it could last over a month, in one place or bouncing around to different locations where you're needed. Perhaps you have the same daily job you're filling in for like a crossing guard, or perhaps you're going from place to place filling in odd jobs for service projects like rescuing cats.

Notes:
+ Public Service jobs can be anything that improves the happiness of multiple people over the course of at least a few hours.
+ Or improves the safety of an area once the job is completed, such as clearing debris from the road, or allocating shelter for residents of a disaster area.

DIGITAL DEATH
Epic (Alphazon)

Threat 10
Conflict 7
Reward 10

Chief of Alphazon innovations is the Observer matrix and their link to the Data Crypts, providing even their human employees with immortality or safe storage in a digital afterlife of the company's devising. But something is going wrong: Reapers have taken notice and are causing disturbances and errors in our Data Crypts, killing the digitally immortal & ferrying them away to limbo or elsewhere, including an Exec's own daughter. This won't be tolerated, Alphazon is greenlighting a counter offense. A task force called the Helldivers with spectrotrace equipment to see and follow Reaper activity. Teach Death not to mess with Alphazon, retrieve the VIP.

Notes:
+ The security breach is identified and a patch is ready to go live as soon as you complete your mission as to not alert the Reapers that we're onto their BS.
+ Your Helldiver gear will allow you to force entry into godly domains to retrieve targets -- Do. Not. Get. Caught.
+ You can't keep the Helldiver gear on your person when done, but you can request access to-your gear for monitored excursions. This is because nobody unauthorized can learn of it, or they'll be silenced.
+ Being known for confronting the Reapers isn't a great rep to have, but it's reasonably fine. Getting caught intruding in a divine realm? Instant suicide.

JOB BOARD
Any/Heroic (Independent) - Repeatable

Threat ?
Conflict ?
Reward ?

A staple of many taverns and guild halls: The Job Board, upon which any random person of interest can post a bulletin with the job in question registered with the owner of the board with the payment handed to the establishment ahead of time. Some boards allow any riff raff to post with or without registration, others require fees to register. Depends on where you go. Use this to customize any quest you wish with rewards based on the threat and conflict rating. The Threat and Conflict can be between 1-3 for Folk tier quests, taking a Folk slot, while Nobles can be between 3-6, 6-8 for Heroic, 8-10 for Epic. Reward is 1/2 Threat + 1/2 Conflict.

Notes:
+ Custom Quests can't reward special benefits, only rp to purchase something, unless in-game you're spending that and/or saved rp on a purchase which is rewarded in-context through the quest.
+ Threat and Conflict needs to be at least somewhat warranted by the objects faced by the quest.
+ Indies faction freebie is to make 1 Heroic quest for free, the way they get Heroic's 10 floors for free in Dungeoneering.


SAVE CHRISTMAS
Epic

Threat 9
Conflict 6
Reward 10

HO HO HO-lee, shit. Is that Santa's sleigh? BEING CHASED BY A HECKIN DRAGON? Whoa Santa is jacked. Santa Claus is a male Academic Daeva and head of his own minor faction of elves, changelings, sprites, and gnomes hidden in a sub-plane overlaying the North Pole. He used to deliver presents to everyone in Europe and was expanding until the Masquerade shut his operations down until he shifted gears in how he operates, now he works by more subtly providing gifts that can be excused as natural, coincidental, or lucky breaks all through the Christmas season, and actual presents to magical families. But someone is trying to kidnap him!

Notes:
+ Santa will be abducted somehow and you're a witness, green clad elves need your help tracking down the culprit! Santa is very capable, being an ancient witch with a unique time based perk, so you'll need help to take on whoever could possibly beat him!
+ May need to take his place for some errands.
+ Santa will thank you with an extra reward! He teaches you some Christmas Magic, gaining the ability to know if someone can be classified as Naughty or Nice and top 3 reasons why. You're welcome to crash at the Workshop with some northern hospitality. Mrs. Claus is a legendary cook & the elves are nice.

CELESTIAL CODE
Heroic (Outsiders)

Threat 1?
Conflict 1?
Reward 1?

The Demiurge has personally developed the tools with which to undo Far Entropy and purify Outsider corruption. He has sent archangels to the 42 corners of the Aetheric Sphere to establish sanctuaries and spread His gift. Appearing before you is Archangel Icarus, the one who granted the Watchers their False Light. If you would refuse him, I suggest not taking this quest, or you'll be undone instead of purified: He offers you a radiant white fruit of indescribable splendor and sense of peace. All it would require is you take up a celestial vow of adhering to the classic 10 commandments, and includes things like no lewds outside marriage.

Notes:
+ You are now part of a subfaction: The Sanctified, consuming the fruit with real intent will eliminate your corruption and unbind you from the Far Gods, you will instead be bound to a similarly esoteric celestial. You may still have Monstrosity, which will have a celestialized theme, and you can
+  The vow IS part of making the sanctification work, not merely a prerequisite to being given the fruit. It does not work without it by necessity, not design. You're unlinking from Far Gods to link with a great celestial engine designed for this. 
+ You would be tasked with purifying or undoing other outsiders.

WONDER BAZAAR
Noble

Threat 4
Conflict 3
Reward 4

Some chain of events leads to you confronting an assassin after a peculiar artifact you discovered earlier, perhaps in a prior quest. A golden ticket and clues on the assassin’s body, dead or not, leads you to a supernatural town hidden by the veil with a thriving market. The ticket grants you entry into the Wonder Bazaar, where you meet a merchant who wants to trade the artifact for one of:

- A Feytouched Wing Which turns you or one of your willing companions into a PIXIE or FAIRY
- A Twinstone Gem: Which turns you or one of your willing companions into a GEMINI
- A Gilded Collar. Which turns you or one of your willing companions into a GENIE

Notes:
+ If you instead keep the artifact, you will run into a stranger who will sell you a key for 20 power, unlocking the artifact, Granting: “Jin” [Choose a Name]
+ Jin is an exception to the racial clause against witch masters. However, that does mean you may need to be prepared to fight other witches over her if they find out! 
+ Companions made into Gemini twins will need to split their magics and perks as evenly as possible, try to balance them. Feel free to start as one of these races yourself if you wish.
