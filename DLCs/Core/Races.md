# Core

## Race: Neutral
- Elements: Soul, Body
- Mana capacity: Medium
- Mana rate: Medium

The overwhelming majority of witches are Neutrals. There is nothing visually abnormal about them (by default). Even some witches who have the option to awaken as another race may want to choose to be Neutral for its baseline casual existence, no new dependencies or anything abnormal to consider. They’re effectively the “Human” witch, but witches refer to them as neutral rather than human to distinguish them from the mundane. They age slower than humans, at half the rate, and do so very gracefully, and they tend to be more attractive than the average human, and are harder to kill, with more efficient biology to reduce inconveniences with less biological requirements than normal by 25%, and prevent dying from a papercut, or from a tiny air bubble in the wrong place.

__Neutrals draw Mana__ from Sleep, recovering around 1% of their Mana per hour of sleep, doubling per hour. 2 hours is more impactful than two 1 hour naps for example, regaining 16% for their 5th hour for a total of 31%, then 63% total for 6hrs.

### Perk
- Cost: 4

You have a “Second Spark” of untapped potential that you can work with and expand with time and effort. At the upfront investment into this perk, you have this spark, which you can feed with effort.

You can choose a second class type to gain that class type’s growth method, you need only find balance in managing the two separate means of growth.

In the face of a world of magical threats, you also resist magic damage and magical hazard durations by 20%, giving an edge.


## Race: Daeva
- Elements: Body, Life
- Mana capacity: Medium
- Mana rate: High

Daeva are to humans, what humans are to monkeys. They’re peak evolution and represent the perfection of body and overflowing spark of life. Unlike the other witch types, they’re unnatural for the excess humanity, not the addition of anything new. Where the others may have scales or feathers, you take normal human traits and take them further, with a body like a comic book heroine, a goddess in the flesh, free of any imperfections and basic inconveniences of mortality. They flatly don’t age, forever maintaining a mature but youthful physique. The average daeva height sits around 6ft 6inches up to 8, but short daeva can happen. They’re physically around twice as strong as a human male bodybuilder, without an obvious change in their body tone, and seem to have endless stamina. They feel emotions more strongly, while being in better control of them.

__Daeva draw Mana__ from Emotions, either the presence of high emotions in others, or singular high emotions directed at them. ie; An excited crowd vs a lover are both high.

### Perk
- Cost: 1

Learn to manifest fine tuned control over the functions of body. You can raise or lower your temperature to tolerate limited temperature extremes such as laying comfortably bare in snow, or hot desert sands. You can reduce your heart rate to just one beat per 10 minutes in a trance state where you can survive without air and general delay death for up to weeks. You have perfect fertility control, and you can choose to pass on Witchiness to your offspring to guarantee or prevent witch children, as well as choose sex and gene expression.


## Race: Ifrit
- Elements: Fire, Necro
- Mana capacity: High
- Mana rate: Low

Ifriti are beings native to the elemental plane of fire. Their connection manifests in the most obvious manner of the hitches, as their bodies are burned away in their awakening, their body becoming a living conflagration of flame made flesh anchored and governed by a core skull. They bleed plasma and smoke while limbs severed from their core flicker away like dying flames. The fire of their bodies is slightly above room temp and does not burn, and is tangible enough to touch, feeling like normal flesh, though their hair is more gaseous and warmer. Their body is only a little transparent, enough to see the skull but not all the way through them. They inherently do not age, but can “eat” flammable fuel sources along with traditionally edible materials. Damage to the body is superficial and mended by absorbing flames, though damage to the skull must be healed by traditional means.

__Ifriti draw Mana__ from Burning, the release of energy released by matter through burning caused by the witch.

### Perk
- Cost: 2

Gain the ability to dismantle your body plasma to become a flying skull, and propel yourself on jets of flame up to 200mph, or 10x the speed of your broomstick from Witchery, flying through the air like a missile or rocket. You can explosively start a skull flight while your whole body is still present, it breaking apart to kick start the flight, but regaining your body takes about 30 seconds of reformation.

In skull form, you can only use [Fire] magic or magic that could reasonably be performed without hands.


## Race: Siren
- Elements: Wind, Beast
- Mana capacity: High
- Mana rate: High

Sirens are beings of wind and music, melodies carried by the wind, and have a connection to birds. Their bodies grow leathers in a similar pattern as Nymphs grow scales, though some go further with leather plumage sufficient to be relatively modest without clothing, and are able to transfigure themselves into the form of a specific bird they’re associated with and hybrid states between the two. Whatever the bird type, Sirens are all well known for melodic voices that are deeply pleasant to outright hypnotically attractive. Sirens age at half human rates, and reverse their age through nesting in cocoons of feathers that reverses a year per day. A dead siren who is still intact enough can be nursed back to life by breathing into them a few times a day for 1-3 days depending on severity.

__Sirens draw Mana__ from Breath, whenever they take someone’s breath away, when someone forgets to take a breath, when otherwise unable to breathe, or when the Siren overtly draws the breath from their lungs, within a few inches of their lips.

### Perk
- Cost: 3

Learn to amplify the allure of your voice to project a truly mesmerizing melody that strongly tugs at the psyche of listeners who hear it, carried by the wind an additional 50% further than a voice would normally be carried. Those captivated become oblivious to danger and seek out the voice. You also gain echolocation, able to visualize a 3D map of what your voice touches.

For 2p less, you don’t have to sing; Your voice is permanently hypnotic without your control over it, other than not speaking.


## Race: Naiad
- Elements: Water, Beast
- Mana capacity: High
- Mana rate: High

Naiads are essentially mermaids. Their bodies have very fine scales that range from barely perceptible or providing a scant shimmer when hit by the light, to larger scales, typically concentrated around the back and surfaces facing away, leaving soft exposed skin facing forward fading with a gradient into scales at their shoulders and back, that glitter like precious metal or crystal coins. Naiads age normally outside of water, but when submerged in water they age backwards three times as fast, to their prime, equivalent to human at 20. A dead Naiad with a mostly intact body can be submerged in water to slowly bring them pack over a few days to a few weeks depending on severity. All naiads can focus to transfigure their legs into a long scaled tail with a fan-like fin for rapid swimming, exceeding 60mph, or 52.1 knots, on average. They absorb oxygen from water through their skin.

__Naiads draw Mana__ from Submersion, recharging while immersed in water or rain, based on coverage and quantity.

### Perk
- Cost: 2

You have a strong connection to aquatic life with a spark of divine right to rule the sea. You can understand and be understood by any salt water creature greater in size than baby shrimp. Creatures at least as intelligent as a 4 year old human are also subject to passive Suggestion to obey directives.

There is no size or time limit, just an intelligence limit. If you actually have the Suggestion perk as well, your suggestions to less intelligent aquatic life is a strong compulsion even at risk of certain death.


## Race: Dryad
- Elements: Nature, Earth
- Mana capacity: High
- Mana rate: Low

Dryads have plantlike bodies given human form, from which leaves or bark can grow. Many have branches or twigs forming horns or crowns, tiaras, and diadems, that can include berries or fruits. Dryads age normally but are able to assume the form of a tree, in which they can gain any nutrients from light and soil, and de-age at 10x the rate they’d age. The presence of a dryad prevents the growth of infectious diseases and enhances the growth of plants and creatures by 200%, growing with added Vitality. Fruits are sweeter and larger, animals are larger and healthier, etc. All dryads additionally have an internal seed the size of avocado pit. If they die, this pit will grow into a large underground pod with a radiant flower, that will regrow the dryad’s body over 3 months to roughly the equivalent of an 8 year old human. They’ll regain their memories over a week.

__Dryads draw Mana__ from Nurture, from the growth of other living things directly attributable to the Dryad’s effort, whether it’s tending to plants, or feeding a person.

### Perk
- Cost: 2

Some dryads are known for exceptional adaptability. Touch any plant or fungi and you adapt your body to become related to that plant and adopt its traits and abilities, and your tree form becomes a tree-like variant of that plant. Touch a cactus to turn into a giant cactus and in either form, resist desert heat, and you can grow cactus fruit. You grow any fruits or vegetables at normal rates (Unless you have Cornucopia) though other traits take hold immediately. You store one adaptation at a time, touching a new plant to override the previous. Your dryad’s seed becomes more comparable to a fungus, releasing spores on death that scatter, first to mature will awaken while the others wilt.


## Race: Oread
- Elements: Earth, Beast
- Mana capacity: High
- Mana rate: High

Oreads have hair that is more fur-like, and they can have a fine layer of fur over their skin in a similar pattern to the Naiad’s scales or Sirens fur. Like the Siren, they have an associated animal, a land mammal, from foxes or cats to deer or cow. They can morph between this and their true form on a sliding scale. Earth easily gives way for them, allowing them to burrow with ease to the extent they can “swim” through sand, dirt- or bedrock choosing to leave a tunnel or not. Worked earth does not respond to this effect, such as concrete, or shaped stone. They age at half rate and regress to 20ish when they sleep buried in the ground. A dead oread sufficiently intact will return to life over a month if buried, based on severity. Both satyrs and foxgirls are examples.

__Oreads draw Mana__ from Bonds, physical closeness to individuals with a close emotional bond with the witch, whether it’s family, close friends, lovers, even a pet. relaxing together in contact isolated from urgency or stress, only the warmth of cuddles. A long warm hug could fill 20%.

### Perk
- Cost: 3

Your burrowing leaves no trace of disturbance at all after a moment of ripples that return to their original state, and the earth actively aids your movement within it, boosting your speed to your intended destination by 200mph (Plus the speed of your Rod if you have Witchery, including if you have Hellrider. You do not have to be riding it, but you could if you want. An Oread could sculpt earth easily by molding it with their hands, but you can do so with greater ease, simply touching an earthen surface to shape it within 5m (x Earthmoving ranks) to your desired shape within your artistic limits. Earth shaped this way doesn’t count as worked earth.


## Race: Lamia
- Elements: Fire, Beast
- Mana capacity: High
- Mana rate: Medium

Lamiæ are like twin counterparts to the Naiad with a bit of an inversion; Lamiæ by default have the lower body of a snake comparable to the Naiad’s tail but around a third+ longer, being 5-7 times the length of their human upper body. Their body itself may or may not have scales, but they usually have slitted irises and retractile fangs with a venom that induces sleep. Lamiæ can lay an egg that grows a young new body, catching their soul to hatch if later slain.

__Lamiæ draw Mana__ from Consumption, the swallowing of live creatures up to the size of an adult man, which depending on the potency of a Lamia’s distortion, leaves no visible stretching past the throat. Creatures inside passively charge the Lamia’s mana based on the strength of its soul, making most animals non-viable and mortal humans the baseline. A human will charge the Lamia to full over 8 hours, at which point they’d die after growing weaker. They can be released before then. A witch would charge in 1 hour while surviving up to 24hr.

### Perk
- Cost: 4

Your consumption is more refined than most, able to actually utilize the magic energies within and surrounding a witch that you may have consumed. While you have a witch inside you, you can temporarily use one witch specialization up to one rank less than their own and/or use a perk they have. If you fully consume the witch unto death and digest the body, you gain 10 Focus, Might, or Favor for your class type, 1 for humanoids in general.

You’re also able to swallow whole humans with more ease, in seconds instead of a minute or two.


## Race: Aurai
- Elements: Wind, Necro
- Mana capacity: Medium
- Mana rate: High

Aurae are closely associated with the faewilds. Their irises are like kaleidoscopic gemstones, and have slender claw-like nails. Their voice innately carries with it a withering drain that steals a year of life per half second of exposure, which restores the Aurai’s own age to around age 20, banking excess drain. Their screams can induce a horrific vision where the listener is displaced to a random point in time at least 100 years in the past, for anywhere from 1 week to the rest of their life, remaining until they find a glowing butterfly never more than 1 mile away that serves as an anchor, only to return to the moment after they heard the scream, then drop dead if slain in the past at any point. This never affects the existing timeline. When slain, they experience this vision themselves and finding the butterfly resurrects them.

__Aurae draw Mana__ from Displacement, gaining power through the corrective measures involved in covering up paradoxes in the timeline as it mends itself from disruptions caused by sending a being backward in time.

### Perk
- Cost: 4

With significant effort, some aurai are able to figure out a way to harmonize with a wavelength that has resonance with their own timeline. Once every few seconds they can consciously project their intentions to move somewhere they can clearly see, then accelerate their moment in time to skip the travel, or backwards to someplace they were within the past 6 seconds. Moving forward takes a small mana cost per 60 meters, while moving backwards takes just a little more mana per 6 seconds (going back has exponential cost increase) By sacrificing their current memory, they can revert to their physical condition at that time, though they know they jumped back from the future.


## Race: Nymph
- Elements: Water, Life
- Mana capacity: Low
- Mana rate: High

Nymphs have very fine scales similar to the Naiad, but without the larger scales, only the fine scales that cause a slight glitter in the light, and counter-intuitively make their skin feel a little more silky in the spots where they’re present. The obvious difference would be the presence of slender fin-like horns that give them an intuition towards what a person desires. Nymphs age 10x faster than humans, but water washes away age on contact to roughly the equivalent of a human’s 18, more youthful than most witch types get. They do not require any nutrition to sustain themselves, instead relying only on an inherent ability to imbue water with mana to instill it with arcane nutrients, giving it a milky look. A dead nymph can be restored to life through physical intimacy based on the desire, like True Love’s Kiss for example, among others.

__Nymphs draw Mana__ from Desire, whenever desire is directed at them, or instigated by them, whether it’s flirting or a good sales pitch for a new car, proportional to intensity and distance.

### Perk
- Cost: 2

Nymphs figured out a way to bypass their mana capacity limitations by acquiring the ability to reabsorb water they’ve imbued, becoming like an external battery stored for later. A nymph in her pool/bath can store mana and access it later, more like a second charge method, but while in their bath they have direct access, effectively having a massive mana capacity, or using it like a mana potion if separated, a vials worth replenishing 15% their capacity. Nymphs often maintain such baths the way a dragon might protect and enjoy their hoard. They now no longer age if at least vials worth of imbued water is within 30m of them, and gain the [Mind] affinity


## Race: Gorgon
- Elements: Beast, Necro
- Mana capacity: Medium
- Mana rate: Low

Gorgons are known for the snakes growing in or replacing their hair, and some may or may not have bodily scales ranging from fine to large scales at their backs or around joints. Gorgons don’t choose a tertiary affinity, but from Earth, Nature, Water, or Metal, they determine the nature of the gorgon’s petrifying gaze. Any type of Stone, Wood, Ice, or Metal up to the rarity of gold. Unless protected by some means such as a Warding rune, any creature that directly sees the Gorgon’s eyes becomes petrified to the chosen element until dispelled by some means Petrified creatures are in suspended animation with no needs, but are aware and can feel. Gorgons do not age so long as they have a humanoid in stasis. A slain gorgon self-petrifies and slowly self-repairs until whole at a rate of a papercut per minute. Once whole, they resurrect, cracking to reveal a new body equivalent to an 18 year old, unless they were under.

__Gorgons draw Mana__ from Petrification, while a creature is petrified their lost time passively provides the Gorgon with energy.

### Perk
- Cost: 5

Some gorgons have a significantly more dangerous gaze than others. Whether or not gorgon’s eyes are seen, their gaze petrifies everything in their line of sight, slower than if there was eye contact. Simply being in this gorgon’s line of sight will reduce speed by 10% per second, reducing by 10% per second not in line of sight. At 100%, they’re fully petrified as normal, and the gorgon is able to manipulate petrified victims as though they were still living and malleable, allowing poses, and the gorgon can now un-petrify by thinking about it with a touch, selectively, such as their face to let them speak, or for torture.


## Race: Luxal
- Elements: Metal, Life
- Mana capacity: Medium
- Mana rate: Medium

Luxin have an associated metal the way an Oread or Siren have an associated animal. Their bones are formed of this metal, and they can have random metal growths visible on their skin or growing from their body such as a visible metal plate over their sternum, or dotted along their spine, or growths like horns or crowns. Their irises are literal gemstones that match the large gemstone that forms their heart equivalent. They don’t bleed or burn. Metals melt like butter in their mouth, which they eat in addition to normal food. So long as they eat metal, they don’t age for the day. Age can be regressed with overconsumption of metals. A dead Luxal can regrow from their gem heart if submerged in a molten pool of their associated metal, emerging whole as though aging from 0, gaining 1 year per hour spent submerged up to 24.

__Luxin draw Mana__ from Opulence, passively charging from the presence of “wealth” though it has nothing to do with monetary value, but precious metals and stones amplified by skill in working them.

### Perk
- Cost: 3

Learn to trigger explosive growths of your associated gemstone or metal, growing from your body in the way you see fit. You can grow no more metal or stones than you have consumed in the past week, which then doesn’t count to subsequent growth after it is used. Simple shapes like blades or spikes are easy, but precise craftsmanship requires actual artistic skills, though with the skill or a reference on hand, you could create jewelry or mint coins.

Your growths can be disconnected to simply fall off, or can be projected with the force of a 50 cal bullet. How that force translates to the actual projectile depends on the projectile, a spear of metal being slower than a small bolt or bullet shape.


## Race: Kekubi
- Elements: Fire, Body
- Mana capacity: Medium
- Mana rate: High

Kekubi look like living shadows having elemental bodies composed entirely of concentrated pitch black ash, soot, and smoke, which can emanate from them in response to negative thoughts or emotion. Any magic they use can reflect this, being reskinned into black particulates. Such blackened magic is 10% more effective. This soot emanation can cause a bother with blackening things they touch if they aren’t under control. Damage to their bodies is superficial (No critical damage) but comparable overall damage can disperse their body causing death, they can remotely operate severed limbs within a 20m radius. They age like elves, and if slain they crumble into ash to reform over 24 hours if the ashes aren’t scattered, or within 24 hours of at least 50% of their ashes being recombined

For some reason, if they are close to a Doll, they can form Magic Friendship free.

__Kekubi draw Mana__ from Immolation, burning their own body as though they were coal, harmlessly resting on flames with their body absorbing smoke

### Perk
- Cost: 5

Advanced control over the ash, soot, or smoke produced from their body, both what they produce deliberately, and what composes their own body. They can use this to manipulate it (Aesthetically a lot like some form of shadow manipulation) within 30 meters of themselves, in addition to effectively turning any other magic into this manner of soot manipulation. The primary unique usage of this would be the control of their own body, freely breaking apart their body to control it remotely and in pieces as small as a grain of soot, or a full limb, or to levitate themselves in full. They can still receive damage when broken apart, though naturally they’re harder to physically damage (Blunt/Pierce/Slash).


## Race: Sylph
- Elements: Wind, Soul
- Mana capacity: High
- Mana rate: Low

Sylphs might look normal at a glance, the more slender frame can be excused, and the pointed ears are no big deal, but then their hair is perpetually floating ethereally, being weightless, as is their body overall. Slight gusts become significant issues, which Sylphs combat by focusing to partially etherealize, straddling the line between the material and spirit world, unaffected by the wind and invisible to those that can’t perceive spirits. They can will themselves to move omnidirectionally, but can’t phase through matter. They don’t age, remaining around 18 equivalent. A dead sylph’s body disappears leaving the spirit in place, which crystallizes into a cocoon of spirit matter. They age a year per day spent in the crystal, from 0. It will shatter on its own when they reach 18.

__Sylphs draw Mana__ from Spirits, being near high concentrations of naturally occurring spirits or spirit matter, places with history and tragedy. The site of mass graves or terrible battles or old ruins of a building with enough importance or meaning that it left spirit matter echo in the spirit world.

### Perk
- Cost: 3

Some sylphs inherit the ability to take their near-etherealization to the next level; With this perk you can fully phase yourself to ignore solid matter, allowing you to walk through walls. This is a pseudo-biological trait, so you can’t bring other objects along with you that you want, it’s all or nothing. This includes your mothergifts, so you might want to avoid witches and mediums while ethereal, and you’ll need a different escape method if you want to bail out of an area with an object you intended to swipe and I’d recommend learning to summon your mothergifts quicker to regain modesty when you end the ethereal phase. You can’t breathe while phased, but you’re invulnerable to anything that can’t harm a spirit.


## Race: Undine
- Elements: Water, Body
- Mana capacity: Low
- Mana rate: High

 Undine are are comparable to the Ifrit, with elemental bodies entirely composed of water, concentrated into a gelatinous form that can feel like a normal body to the touch, although slick as though oiled lor wet, but if they lose focus their form becomes more and more liquid on a sliding scale. They have a preferred true shape for their appearance, but they can freely focus to adopt any shape with the same volume, though they can separate to reduce their volume or absorb water to add volume up to the volume of a whale. Their water body has all normal senses. They don’t age and have a clear marble as a core. Damage to their body is superficial, but the core can be shattered, without an inherent means of revival if that happens.

__Undine draw Mana__ from Purification, where water based substances that come in contact with an Undine are purified of other elements and contaminants, leaving pure water with trace minerals. Can’t help with anything larger than a pea, but does eliminate sand or dirt as well.

### Perk
- Cost: 2

Undine can be mildly difficult to notice underwater, but some are able to fine tune their body to become perfectly transparent within a body of water. Effectively, an undine with this perk is outright invisible within water and camouflaged within rain, and is able to maintain control and movement in non-solid forms, such as moving around as a puddle, where normal undine would be immobile without becoming more solid. This allows the undine to pass through any surface that water could pass through, such as cracks under a door or seams of improperly sealed wood. You could invade the body of a creature but no, becoming solid within won’t do harm, being limited to available space.


## Race: Sprite
- Elements: Nature, Life
- Mana capacity: Medium
- Mana rate: Medium

Sprites typically denizens of the faewild, Sprites are inherently tiny, about an inch tall, and have an associated winged insect that skews their appearance. All Sprites have wings while a wasp sprite might grow a smooth chitin plating covering their back and limbs to one extent or another. Whatever the insect, all Sprites can produce both silk webbing and honey, and both can be combined to produce hive materials. They have retractile stingers in their wrists that can inject a paralytic venom, which when combined with their honey can form a thick wax that firms up when worked like dough. Bathing in their honey reverses and prevents aging around prime. A dead sprite can be buried in a honey to revive in 3-7 days based on severity.

__Sprites draw Mana__ from Fermentation, of their honey. The traditional method being to store cells made of their own wax and silk full of honey for 7 days, becoming like a mana potion restoring 15% of their mana capacity per drop (About 2 cups equivalent). Sprites produce 1 Tbsp a day.

### Perk
- Cost: 2

You can grow in size up to a height of 4'10\" / 147.32 cm. Still short, but now you can properly interact with normal civilization Your production of silk and honey is upscaled appropriately. and while your venom and honey has more volume, proportional quantity is still required, being diluted, though the honey is just as flavorful and with the same texture. Proportionally, a full sized Sprite could produce about two bathtubs worth of honey per day. Honey production is on demand though an individual could have an overproduction problem. For 2p less, you could have a persistent honey leak.


## Race: Empusa
- Elements: Blood, Necro
- Mana capacity: High
- Mana rate: High

Empusas are a form of vampire born in intense negative emotion and torment. Unlike other witch types, a witch Empusa is frozen in their prior mortal forms, though the witch power still results in male mortals becoming female counterparts if they don’t have Elephant Trunk, as well as being more physically fit. They don’t age, frozen at the age they Awoke, their bodies cold and lifeless with no biological function other than optional lung capacity for scent and speech. Their eyes have an unnatural glow, the color based on the witch’s individual aura, and they have slender hollow fangs with which they suck blood They store up to 5x their body weight in blood without any visual bloat, and are 100% as fast per 1x bodyweight of blood stored. A dead Empusa can be soaked in blood to reanimate them within a minute.

__Empusas draw Mana__ from Blood, draining the equivalent of one whole human to death fully charges their mana. Animals are a tenth as effective. An Empusa relies on their mana and will die if fully depleted but their charge also mends their body

### Perk
- Cost: 5

Magnify the corruption sustaining you in order to acquire the [Wind] tag in addition to the Empusa’s other elements. You can adopt a mist form in which you’re hard to recognize and can’t interact physically, while being effectively immune to physical harm, though energetic harm can still get you. Your speed is unaffected but you can fly. Transitioning between mist and physical only takes a second. Mist or not, you can see in pitch blackness. Additionally, you’re 4x as strong, fast, and reactive.

For -15p (epic), you can also or instead take SYWTB A Vampire CYOA: [https://imgur.com/a/wDLuzus]


## Race: Lilin
- Elements: Fire, Mind
- Mana capacity: High
- Mana rate: Low

Lilin witches can trace their way back to infernal lineages- to a family line that escaped or earned their way out of hell. They have different types of horns and leathery wings, and tail(s) in different styles, and skin tinted some unnatural color. Markings on their body brand them as free demons. They have a second set of transparent eyelids that give them thermal vision, and they can’t be burned, entirely comfortable lounging in or on lava flows. They do not age, and if slain they do find themselves back in hell to serve time for any misdeeds, but anyone who knows their name and the marking on their body can summon them with Consortation 3. If summoned, they don’t have to return when dismissed, but summoners can include a pact they have to accept if they want to be summoned.

__Lilin draw Mana__ from Taboo, when they draw pleasure from scenarios that they themselves believe is wrong when observed by another who also believes it is wrong. Such as seducing someone into cheating on another, or public indecency.

### Perk
- Cost: 3

The quintessential gift of the desire demon, almost always present with high level succubi: Lilins with this perk can invade the dreams of any sleeping creature capable of understanding language. The lilin then establishes a full lucid dream that is under their control, though witches with Beauty Sleep or Digicasting can resist and fight for control. Within these dreams the lilin can negotiate with the creature to establish a pact where they consent to maintaining this dream, and they won’t wake up unless freed by a third party or the lilin. Any taboo within the dream still counts for charge.


## Race: Erinyes
- Elements: Wind, Blood
- Mana capacity: Medium
- Mana rate: High

Erinyes witches can trace their Way back to celestial lineages- to a fallen angel, a past incarnation of themselves. They have boney dark feathered wings and their skin is marked with inky black stains showing where their tears fell in the process of branding them with celestial runes identifying their sin and punishment. The celestial faction may or may not be related to the celestials behind Abrahamic religions. Erinyes cease aging between 18-26 and if slain, can re-awaken from a new mortal host somewhere unless ritually sacrificed, which stops their reincarnation for a century. Erinyes have a peculiar effect wherein the last person to physically harm them receives a mirror of any further harm to the Erinyes for 24hrs.

__Erinyes draw Mana__ from Pain, when they cause another being physical or emotional torment, amplified by vocal expressions of that suffering; ie screams or crying. Note; This could be consensual in the case of certain tastes, or a something like a scream house attraction where some are there for it Or they might even be a physical therapist.

### Perk
- Cost: 3

Some Erinyes are able to channel their curse to harm themselves with a blade or piercing object if there is currently an active curse mirroring harm onto another. That other can then be directly harmed by the weapon that has the Erinyes’s own blood on it. The next attack that harms the linked creature can be healed as normal, but the pain will forever remain fresh and will have an ink black scar. These marks of pain last until removed by a Cheraphim and can affect creatures protected by runes of warding, as it’s considered indirect, riding on the physical attack. (Likewise, the Erinyes’s curse itself works)


## Race: Hannya
- Elements: Water, Mind
- Mana capacity: High
- Mana rate: Medium

Hannya are known as raging drunkards heavily addicted to alcohol, almost always blushed with at least a light buzz. They have long slender horns that also “blush” like their cheeks. This blush effect is amplified into overdrive when they experience strong passions, turning bright red when enflamed by anger, which easily applies to most combat scenarios among other things as they have a habit of working themselves up. The redder they get, the more physical prowess they have, both in strength, and dexterity, and general stamina. They actually age in reverse, but whenever they are completely drunken their age will change to represent how they imagine themselves or want to be on a whim until they become sober. A dead Hannya can be brought back to life by first mending the body, then dousing with ice cold water.

__Hannya draw Mana__ from Alcoholism, drinking alcohol isn’t just a quirk but their primary energy source. They aren’t immune to getting drunk, but don’t experience hangovers.

### Perk

## Race: Taura
- Elements: Nature, Beast
- Mana capacity: Low
- Mana rate: Medium

Taurai are very obvious at a glance for their large animal lower “halves” where the upper torso of a human from the hips up replace an animal head and neck, the whole body shoulders-down of another animal replacing what would be their human legs. They may or may not have animal features on their head or back as well up to the extent of being Sphinx-like. This can be any legged animal from lizard or spider to rabbit or horse. This is usually a hoofed animal but pawed animals aren’t that rare, and spider taura are fairly common in places. Their lower bodies are generally powerful and have a high sprint speed and endurance.

__Taura draw Mana__ from Conservation, when acting in harmony with a natural state of being, which generally revolves around sustainability and continuity of life, land protecting nature or historical artifacts or buildings 60+ years old.

It feels like the planet shrinks to a small planetoid where you can clearly see the curvature on the horizon and see ghostly models and representations of the actual landscape of the world.

Within one of these spaces, they can see a tangible fourth wall somewhere within that acts like a window through the painting or page into the real world, but this can be shifted to show through any other painting or page with the same image or description, and then step through this fourth wall to return. They all share the same space and something can be left within it, while something taken tums to ink or paint outside.


## Race: Doll
- Elements: Soul, Necro
- Mana capacity: Low
- Mana rate: High

Dolls are artificial beings. If you’ve awakened into a Doll form, your soul is likely a reincarnation of a soul used in the creation of a Doll in the past but it could be exposure to experimental energies that corrupted your witch type. Dolls get their name as most Dolls are literally ball jointed dolls of wood or porcelain but dolls can also be fully organic made of sewn flesh of different body parts, others are clockwork, or recently Alphazon has been making fullsynth dolls. Black market deals in Asia have been making dolls with limited self-governance and selling them.

Dolls don’t age or have biological functions by default, though some can have living organic parts. A doll can’t die, only cease function. If repaired then they regain function. They have all normal senses, even touch- Pain or pleasure both, but a maker can adjust these along with personality elements or even memory,

Any body can be repaired as normal to resume function, but even when a body would be incapable of moving on its own, it can be remotely puppeted by force from a still functioning body. Every doll body can then also have a secondary form between 6 inches and 2ft tall that is a reduced quality depiction of the full appearance, like a literal child’s doll of themselves.


## Race: Vanir
- Elements: Water, Nature
- Mana capacity: High
- Mana rate: High

Vanir are beings associated with winter, and hidden groves of life amid the frost. The presence of a vanir will allow plant life to thrive in the cold and while creatures will still feel cold, they won’t suffer actual harm, including themselves, though they don’t feel discomfort at all with the cold. Their bodies are blue, white, or gray emitting a cold chill, from which ice crystals form like scales, spikes, or horns.

Vanir age normally until their apparent age freezes randomly between 18-25. A slain vanir flash freezes and shatters into a mist of ice crystals. Somewhere within the nearest tundra (such as a snowcapped mountain peak), a new body will form out of ice over 3 months, then crack to free them with new life.

__Vanir draw Mana__ from Resistance, when acting against a natural state of being both in nature and in social dynamics, such as going against popular opinion, or resisting baser natural desires, not wearing many layers in the cold, or turning down that slice of cheesecake.

Creation is near instant, but can’t have moving parts, and is created within 60m, but trail of ice must travel to where you intend to create the object (if the object wouldn’t be touching your hand already), moving at 10m per second.


## Race: Changeling
- Elements: Body, Mind
- Mana capacity: Medium
- Mana rate: Medium

Some universes only produce Witches as changelings, albeit usually under different mechanics. Changelings look like human children anywhere from 0 to 14, and are notably able to freely shapeshift in the blink of an eye to assume any other appearance that matches that description, including perfectly copying the appearance of another at a glance. A changeling cannot physically age past 14 or even use transformation magic to push past it and are biologically immortal. A slain changeling will re-awaken from a mortal human child randomly within the same plane/realm. (ie; Earth), replacing them. The replaced soul and mind will find itself in The Nursery (A realm).

__Changelings draw Mana__ from Identity, any interactions had wherein another believes the changeling to be someone that they knew. An impatient changeling is able to sow doubt and uncertainty in order to briefly spike mana gain to High. Worth noting that changelings very often have the *Charge Swap* perk, or seek out a way to gain it. It costs 3p less for them.

### Perk
- Cost: 4

While they can freely assume the appearance of any young humanoid, some changelings have an enhanced shapeshifting to assume the form of any object with volume like that of a ping pong ball, up to that of a fridge.

These changelings can now also assume the form of mature humanoids. In either case, they have to have a visible reference to work off of and it only includes details the changeling knows about. Turn into specific person and you might not know about their mole by their nethers, for example, or the inner workings behind the fridge.


## Race: Elf
- Elements: Body, Nature
- Mana capacity: High
- Mana rate: Medium

Elves once ruled Earth, as plentiful as modern humans currently are, with great empires of megalithic works and a global atmospheric energy grid... anyway, surviving elves come in Sun, Moon, and Sky varieties. Suns are golden-bronze skinned and favor forests. Moons are silvery-plum skinned and favor subterranean living, typically short. Sky elves are fair skinned and taller than most. Elves start out aging like humans but rapidly slow down. 100 is equivalent to a human’s 18, while they might look 30 at 1,000 and never exceed looking like 40. A slain elf will resurrect at the last Elven Lifeshrine they interacted with (Or their parent if they haven’t yet). Lifeshrines are rare on Earth, but most factions will have at least one. Also, Elves are *not* lewd, they’re a proud & noble people darn it.

__Elves draw Mana__ from Meditation, entering a trance-like state where they look conscious but immobile with eyes glazed over. They charge 25% Mana per hour, and an hour of trance is comparable to 2 hours of deep restful sleep.

These elves can balance in any position on any surface, allowing them to stand on a knife edge provided the sole of their shoe can withstand it. They can walk on walls or on ceilings. They could jump and touch a ceiling with one finger to lift themselves up to stand upright, upside down on the ceiling. Again, so long as the surface would be able to support them. Note elves weigh half as much as you would expect them to, and they’re often slender.


## Race: Orc
- Elements: Body, Earth
- Mana capacity: High
- Mana rate: Low

Orcs were widely present along with the elves with a hostile relationship back then. Orcs come in three colors, green with tusks, red with horns, and blue with neither.

They typically have elf-like ears, but are known for being strongly built and large in stature with an average height of 6'8\\". They have low light vision capable of seeing in dark with the faintest light source, and can go without any air for hours, or days on thin air. Orcs have a sense for ore and fault lines. Orcs age normally, but when an orc dies they are reborn from the closest member of their family tree to rapidly age back to 20 equivalent within 3 months.

__Orcs draw Mana__ from Birth, fueled by the growth of new life created by the orc More effective for female orcs growing it themselves, male orcs have about a tenth the same energy gain while a currently pregnant orc gains charge very rapidly then it levels out into background charge as the offspring grow.

### Perk
- Cost: 5

Orcs with this trait are paragons of will and can endure any treatment or guile without faltering. Their sense of pain is dulled, and their force of will can allow them to survive total organ failure for hours while walking on shattered shins over a field of glass. So long as one muscle fiber is intact, their limbs will not give up. Even severed, an orc limb remembers its last goal. A beheaded orcs body continuing to fight, the head surviving for a few hours. Any orc parent gains this perk for free when their children are in danger, ending when they are out of harm’s way.


## Race: Pharon
- Elements: Beast, Soul
- Mana capacity: High
- Mana rate: Low

Pharon are animal-headed people that have been treated as gods in some human cultures. They have human bodies but the head and neck of an animal creature, somewhat opposite to the taura. This can be any animal including insects, if it’s an animal, it’s valid. They’ll have any abnormal features and functions the animal head would normally have, from a beetle’s mandibles to the eyes and neck rotation of an owl. They age as normal but are capable of creating ambrosia by distilling light between their hands. A Pharon consuming ambrosia will cease aging for 3 days during which time for each additional “Serving” they’ll age in reverse at an increasing rate. If slain, ambrosia can return their body to life if placed inside the body (or in the ash pile).

__Pharon draw Mana__ from Renown, fueled by their notoriety one way or another but increases proportional to intensity of feelings. The greater the respect, fear, reverence, or even hate and so on, the higher the charge in that moment of thought. They can feel their name spoken.

### Perk
- Cost: 4

Pharon with this perk have a faint golden aura surrounding their head they can suppress autonomously just by thinking that they want to be sneaky, otherwise if they think they want to be ostentatious, it can illuminate a room.

Their head is invulnerable to damage anywhere there is skin, and their bite force is capable of biting through steel plates an inch thick, and chewing it. Though they probably don’t want to swallow it. If they have a beak or something similar like a horn, their neck has enough force to puncture said steel plates.


## Race: Jotun
- Elements: Body, Blood
- Mana capacity: Medium
- Mana rate: Low

Jotun are a truly ancient race that reigned prior to the antediluvian elven kingdoms where they were slaves. They can grow to 15 meters in height on demand with a around a 15% mana drain, negligible drain to return to normal. Proportional strength and speed. They can remain in either size indefinitely. Jotun cease aging} at 31 for males, 21 for females, though they all share the same max height. If slain, a jotun has a second body 1/30th off their size located where a heart would be encased in a crystal-like calcium shell impervious to most things short of a rift blade. This shell cracks to free and wake the body reborn in 3 days if slain at full size, 3 weeks if slain in human size.

__Jotun draw Mana__ from Flesh. Any meat will provide Charge but, naturally, creatures with greater souls give greater charge... humans, or more still, witches Animal meats low, human is medium, witch is high. Charge is passive while digesting. Humanoid flesh gives them a spine-tingling sense of bliss that can be addictive. leading to some unpleasantries.

### Perk
- Cost: 4

A Corrupted jotun’s giant form loses their skin leaving exposed muscle and fat tissues. Their flesh is as resistant to harm as steel with twice the strength of a normal jotun. The jotun is capable of rapid regeneration, passively regenerating the equivalent of a bullet wound per second. They can focus to enhance their regeneration with 10% of their mana capacity to instantly regenerate a lost limb or equivalent. Additionally, their size change is more intimidating. Jotun that are lost to addiction to human meat get this perk free, but they’re mindless predators.


## Race: Hollow
- Elements: Soul, Metal
- Mana capacity: High
- Mana rate: Low

Hollows are a race of people that are a merger of spirit and metal. They have bodies that behave like spirits, and spirits that behave like bodies. Their physical body is invisible and intangible, but bound to a suit of armor, and casts a colored glow based on their aura. Their spirit form on the other hand, has biological processes, which is how Hollows reproduce. In their spirit form with any other spirit. Their physical form carrying the offspring will have a visible orb of metal with a will-o-wisp-like glow around it, internally within their own suit of armor which will then grow over time as it collects metals and minerals. They eat spirit matter to survive, much like a Spirit Beast, but can consume spirit objects, not just “living” spirits. The armor heals the way a body would, or with healing magics. Their spirit can remove the armor, but can only move within 30ft of it. A Hollow “Dies” if their armor is destroyed to the point of unusability, but can be brought back to life by reforging their armor if any part of it remains to incorporate in it.

__Hollows draw Mana__ from Ore. They place raw ore within their armor where it suspends and breaks down over time, and is used for the armor’s integrity.

### Perk
- Cost: 4

Hollows by default are able to incorporate ores they burned into the material composition of their armor, but some are more adaptive than others. Hollows with this perk can actively break down and replace their armor with ores, ingots, or any source of metal, and can incorporate special metals such as Mythril, or Adamantine, if they can find it. The process causes their armor to tile away in flakes as new flakes settle into place, within a few feet of distance from the materials used. This can also be used to actively heal them, siphoning materials on the fly for patch jobs repairing their armor at the rate of a gauntlet per second, with enough materials sufficient to replace the injury.


## Race: Dwarf
- Elements: Earth, Metal
- Mana capacity: Medium
- Mana rate: High

Dwarves are a short race that stands between 3-4f tall. They have larger eyes proportionally to most humanoids. They’re very long lived like elves but they stay more youthful for longer, never growing more from their youthful state until they begin wrinkling with old age after 300+ years. The main way to tell a Dwarf’s age is the length of their hair (or beard for males, & muscles, more pronounced in males). Every dwarf has an associated metal up to the rarity of gold, which grows in fine threads like hair, including the beard of male dwarves, and their bones are all high carbon steel, their muscle sinews dense with incorporated metals, making them extremely hardy and durable as though armored with bones that very rarely break, though heavier than an Orc They seem to have boundless stamina and laser focus their pursuits.

They have low-light vision & don’t need air. A dead Dwarf given a dwarven burial (even if no body remains) can be reborn to a relative, to regain memories at age 10. Someone can volunteer at the funeral.

__Dwarves draw Mana__ from Community, the presence of other dwarves or creatures with this charge method. Low with 1 other, Med with 6, High with 20+.

### Perk
- Cost: 3

Dwarves tend to have secretive & protective societies, but the dwarves you see outside of their underground stronghold cities are out on a mission with unrelenting focus giving two notable reputations: You can take this twice, once for each.

*A) Giantslayers*, certain dwarves are invigorated by ancestral spirits when facing giants (6.6ft+), empowering their speed and damage dealt by 50%.

*B) Manabanes*, certain dwarves have particular bloodlines that react to the presence of hostile magics. The duration of any detrimental magic effect is reduced by 75%. Even if no duration is shown, they can auto dispel in 3 days, and have 25% magic damage resistance.


## Race: Wither
- Elements: Necro, Metal
- Mana capacity: High
- Mana rate: Medium

Withers are cursed people as a result of the horrific actions of their ancestors or past incarnation of themselves. They’ll be born thinking they’re Neutral but will be plagued with bad fortunes and health issues. At around age 18, they’ll die of a mysterious condition only to rise again in 3 days to a cold body with blackened limbs rotting on the bone. They’re no longer unlucky, but their undead body continually tries to rot from the extremities inward, they’d have skeletal fingers by the time their shoulders begin to blacken, over a week duration, They can delay and reverse decay through cannibalizing humanoid flesh leaving behind a skeleton, to regrow their own and remain whole for 1 week. An arm for an arm, body for body, ect. They can do this at a distance of 30ft. They have an aura of decay that makes people feel ill, and rapidly rusts metals. A nail would be dustin a minute They cannot die, they continue to reanimate every full moon unless impaled on a gold or silver spike with coins over the eyes / eye sockets.

__Withers draw Mana__ from Rot, empowered by the presence of rotting organic matter, particularly meats, proportional to the quantity, & the sapience of the body in life.

### Perk
- Cost: 5

Some withers have a fearsome ability to generate a sand composed of heavily rusted metals that flows out from their body. Enough to fill a small backyard pool. These sands act as a strong acid that rapidly decays organic matter, plant or animal, dead or living. It doesn’t affect bones and has reduced effect on skin, leaving desiccated husks behind in a few seconds. The wither can control this sand as an extension of their will within 60m. The sand returns to their body when they wish it, but they slowly replace it over time at a buckets worth a day. The sand itself can have physical force comparable to a chainsaw, heavy blade, or maul, leaving rusty wounds. Tetanus hazard.


## Race: Mimi
- Elements: Beast, Life
- Mana capacity: Low
- Mana rate: High

Mimis are animal people much like Oreads, but lack the Earth connection, and come in two flavors of Amazons and Halflings, some subspecies being over 6ft tall while the others rarely exceed 4'8\\" Like Oreads, they have an associated animal that they attribute, usually mammals but it could be any natural animal. They’re almost always lighthearted people full of life and vibrance, where Oreads can often be a melancholic sort, introverts to the Mimi’s extroversion (On average). They can be impulsive and seem to naturally have improved luck hard to quantify, otherwise they benefit from typical tropes associated with their animal reference, having about 2 “Traits” (Stacks with Familiarity) other than physical characteristics which don’t count against this. Mimi’s stop aging at roughly 18 for halflings, or between 25-35 for amazons. A dead mimi can be brought back to life by erecting a shrine to them, and a tear drop.

__Mimis draw Mana__ from Headpats, Belly Rubs, and Back Scratches, or similar forms of contact, recovering 5% of their mana capacity per second of contact. A Mimi can headpat themselves for 0.5%, but this makes them feel depressed and teary for some reason.

### Perk
- Cost: 4

Mimis have some animal traits in addition to a couple physical characteristics, but with this perk they have an additional 2 general traits that you would associate with their animal type, and these two traits can be considerably stronger and supernatural in nature, with folklore and legends as valid inspiration for the associated trait, such as raccoons using tanuki folklore as a basis for a trait or two.

Non-folklore traits can also be taken for one of these traits, and they’ll be augmented further. A normal trait granting strength might make you as strong as an adult male strongman, but an augmented trait like this could instead make you as strong as four such strongmen, for example.


## Race: Sword
- Elements: Metal, Blood
- Mana capacity: Low
- Mana rate: Low

Wait what? Oh I’ve heard of these before. Huh, you may be a Sword Yeah, a sentient sword and a living relic. “Swords” have a humanoid body that can visually look like any other race shown here, but they adopt a sword form that is their true form. If unconscious or slain, they’d adopt their sword form. They have no biological needs, but do age up until age 20 equivalent, their sword form starting out as a knife and will grow with their body over time into some type of sword based on their personality, Can include polearms, just swords with long handles, and axes, weird swords with long handles, or hammers... swords with very weird flat blades. Don’t ask questions, just stab. Their sword form heals over time, damage reflecting in their humanoid body. A dead sword can be brought to life by using the inert sword to take a life. In sword form, they have all their magic abilities without requiring hands, and all magic manifests in some sword related way. They can synchronize with the thoughts and intentions a wielder.

__Swords draw Mana__ from Battle, gaining MP during conflict. Increases to Med after 2 minutes, & High after 10 minutes.

### Perk
- Cost: 5

Swords with this perk are able to form especially strong bonds to a Wielder, or sometimes called a Master, depending on the school of thought involved. It takes a week to synchronize to a new wielder but once synchronized once it only takes a few minutes to re-adapt to a prior wielder. The Sword and Wielder merge their Mana capacity and Charge rates, and each are capable of using all Magic Specializations and Perks that the other possesses, when within a 1km radius of each other, and at any distance they can send telepathic messages to one another. They can cooperate to perform Harmony magic with extreme ease, their harmony magics being 100% more potent.
