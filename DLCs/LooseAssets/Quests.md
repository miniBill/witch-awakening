## Quest: Save Christmas
- Slot: Epic
- Threat: 9
- Conflict: 6
- Reward: 10

HO HO HO-lee, shit. Is that Santa’s sleigh? BEING CHASED BY A HECKIN DRAGON? Whoa Santa is jacked. Santa Claus is a male Academic Daeva and head of his own minor faction of elves, changelings, sprites, and gnomes hidden in a sub-plane overlaying the North Pole. He used to deliver presents to everyone in Europe and was expanding until the Masquerade shut his operations down until he shifted gears in how he operates, now he works by more subtly providing gifts that can be excused as natural, coincidental, or lucky breaks all through the Christmas season, and actual presents to magical families. But someone is trying to kidnap him!

Notes:
+ Santa will be abducted somehow and you’re a witness, green clad elves need your help tracking down the culprit! Santa is very capable, being an ancient witch with a unique time based perk, so you’ll need help to take on whoever could possibly beat him!
+ May need to take his place for some errands.

### Sidebar
Santa will thank you with an extra reward! He teaches you some Christmas Magic, gaining the ability to know if someone can be classified as Naughty or Nice and top 3 reasons why. You’re welcome to crash at the Workshop with some northern hospitality. Mrs. Claus is a legendary cook & the elves are nice.


## Quest: Celestial Code
- Slot: Heroic
- Faction: Outsiders
- Threat: 10
- Conflict: 10
- Reward: 10

The Demiurge has personally developed the tools with which to undo Far Entropy and purify Outsider corruption. He has sent archangels to the 42 corners of the Aetheric Sphere to establish sanctuaries and spread His gift. Appearing before you is Archangel Icarus, the one who granted the Watchers their False Light. If you would refuse him, I suggest not taking this quest, or you’ll be undone instead of purified: He offers you a radiant white fruit of indescribable splendor and sense of peace. All it would require is you take up a celestial vow of adhering to the classic 10 commandments, and includes things like no lewds outside marriage.

Notes:
+ You are now part of a subfaction: The Sanctified, consuming the fruit with real intent will eliminate your corruption and unbind you from the Far Gods, you will instead be bound to a similarly esoteric celestial. You may still have Monstrosity, which will have a celestialized theme, and you can

### Sidebar
The vow IS part of making the sanctification work, not merely a prerequisite to being given the fruit. It does not work without it by necessity, not design. You’re unlinking from Far Gods to link with a great celestial engine designed for this. 
You would be tasked with purifying or undoing other outsiders.


## Quest: Wonder Bazaar
- Slot: Noble
- Threat: 4
- Conflict: 3
- Reward: 4

Some chain of events leads to you confronting an assassin after a peculiar artifact you discovered earlier, perhaps in a prior quest. A golden ticket and clues on the assassin’s body, dead or not, leads you to a supernatural town hidden by the veil with a thriving market. The ticket grants you entry into the Wonder Bazaar, where you meet a merchant who wants to trade the artifact for one of:

- A Feytouched Wing Which turns you or one of your willing companions into a Pixie or Fairy
- A Twinstone Gem: Which turns you or one of your willing companions into a Gemini
- A Gilded Collar. Which turns you or one of your willing companions into a Genie

Notes:
+ If you instead keep the artifact, you will run into a stranger who will sell you a key for 20 power, unlocking the artifact, Granting: “Jin” [Choose a Name]

### Sidebar
Jin is an exception to the racial clause against witch masters. However, that does mean you may need to be prepared to fight other witches over her if they find out! 
Companions made into Gemini twins will need to split their magics and perks as evenly as possible, try to balance them. Feel free to start as one of these races yourself if you wish.
