# Loose Assets

## Race: Xeno
- Elements: Beast, Blood
- Mana capacity: Medium
- Mana rate: High

Xenos are a new species only discovered in the last 10 years by an Alphazon research team on Titan. A crashed ship from outside the solar system. Normal Xenos are monstrous predators, but after killing some witches on the team, they started hatching hybrids that are more humanoid and less feral. These hybrids have established a colony. They run at 120mph, can throw cars, and have hard carapaces equivalent to mithril armor with claws and bladed tails. Remarkably quiet in movement and can see infrared and UV.

__Xenos draw Mana__ from _Eggs_, laid by the xeno if female. Male xenos benefit from the eggs laid by their parent or eggs laid by their own mate. Each egg individually provides about 1% total mana per minute af fa range of 500 meters, .5 for an additional 500, .1 in another 500. Stacks. Eggs can’t be fertilized after being laid, remaining as mana batteries, but are fertilized during formation like the sexual reproduction most witches are familiar with. An egg lasts 1 month before running dry, unless supplied blood. 1 drop = 1% charge.

- Cost: 10

Some Xenos seem to have a natural affinity for working biomatter. Gain Necromancy 3 and Hexes 3.

Their body is also enhanced, their outer plating is just as sleek as it was, but is twice as hard and they resist energetic damage by 75% (Cold, Heat, Electricity, Radiation, ect). Xenos by default already can exist comfortably in vacuum as well as high pressures.

Using Necromancy to manipulate their own flesh and bone consumes no mana, neither does using Hexes, to work with their own biomatter, including eggs, allowing them to easily create networks of biomatter like veins to connect eggs in order to keep them supplied with blood.


## Race: Cyborg
- Elements: Body, Metal
- Mana capacity: Medium
- Mana rate: High

Cyborgs can be simulated a number of ways but this Cyborg type is a particular instance and a common type of witch back on Terra Prima, combining flesh and synthetic components. Cyborgs don’t age past their appearance, and a dead cyborg will have a small backup chip that can be inserted into a new cyborg body. Cyborgs can have up to 5 mundane items integrated into their body for use in some manner.

__Cyborgs draw Mana__ from Electricity, using internal reactors, typically in the form of fuel pellets, little beads any alchemist can learn to make using stardust and a potion of stamina of any rank. R1: Restores 1% mana capacity per minute for up to 24 hrs. R2: 2%. R3:5%. R4: 10% per 30 seconds for 1 hour. R5: 25% per 10 seconds for half an hour. A cyborg with no fuel pellet will feel a hunger-like sensation

They can of course tap into any power source to drain electricity at the rate at which the system is rated for, such as 1,50 watts for an outlet, which can charge 5% per minute. Cyborgs are not immune to electrical damage from unregulated attacks.

### Perk
- Cost: 6

While all cyborgs have some degree of passive regeneration capable of providing healing / maintenance to inorganic parts of their body, it isn’t particularly notable or versatile beyond that. Cyborgs with this type perk however, have built in internal nanofabricators, little factories that produce femtomachines. This allows them to mend their body at a rapid rate, repairing damage comparable to a bullet wound every few seconds, and can fully repair their body, both synthetic and organic parts. Additionally, they can take Gadgetry and/or Integration at half price as though they had affinity for it, and when they do they are not linked to Alphazon, and their Gadgetry can be produce from their body on demand. Utilizing a silver swarm, if the witch has Metallurgy it’s usage costs half the mana it would normally.


## Race: Spider
- Elements: Beast, Metal
- Mana capacity: Medium
- Mana rate: High

A species of *Manaweaver* spiders that can produce witches, but usually it’s humans who awaken and turn into one. The size of a human hand, they can produce a foot of semi-metallic webbing per minute as thick as yarn, their bites can paralyze any creature not magically protected, they climb walls as you’d expect. They age comparable to a human but can cocoon themselves for 48 hours to emerge youthful again, between 12-24 depending on how long they were cooking in there. A dead Spider witch can assume direct control over the body of any unintelligent children they’ve created by laying eggs in the hundreds, only creating intelligent spiders if they reproduce sexually if you must know.

__Spiders draw Mana__ from Bondage. Look, I know how that sounds and that’s not wrong either, but so long as a spider has a human or supernatural creature bound in their webbing, they produce charge similar to a gorgon’s stash of statues. Bound targets each provide about 1% capacity per min. A willing participant provides 5%. If a bound target is killed, it provides an instant +50%.

### Perk
- Cost: 8

There are those among the spiders that can adopt the shape of a much smaller spider for convenience, between the size of a dime or a half dollar, or they can freely assume the form of a much larger spider that in its normal stance would be eye level with an adult human male’s chest. In this form their exoskeleton is plated like thick steel armor, and their speed matches that of a sports car.

In this form they can produce webbing as thick and sturdy as a metal cable on demand capable of reaching roughly 100 meters when launched, easily latching on to nearly any surface, or they can create 10ft increments of nanowebbing very difficult to see that when properly anchored will slice through bone with just the force of a victim walking into it.

The Spider can now learn Arachnescence, at a faction discount, their web is 3x durable.

Spiders that take Metamorphosis can take the Zooarch form of a great spider. With r5 Arachnescence, they can instead choose the form of the Basilisk, replacing the snake aesthetics with the arachne aesthetics to your description, spider eyes function the same as the snake heads. For size, their spider body matches the zooarch, plus the human upper body adding height Each eye can think separately as mirrors of the same consciousness.


## Race: Gnome
- Elements: Nature, Metal
- Mana capacity: Medium
- Mana rate: High

Gnomes are tiny inventive people that even in the wilds in history they were a productive and innovative people relying heavily on cunning works of primitive engineering to construct safe communities and traps to deal with a world of far larger threats, working with trees, roots, and earth. Now they’re natural at working metals into complex contraptions. They stand only 4 inches tall but have the strength of a typical humanoid child, impressive for their size, and the speed of a cat with strong limbs and durable bodies that are near immune to blunt damage

__Gnomes draw Mana__ from Tinkering, any time they create anything, they gain mana from doing so proportional to the material value, skill necessary, and time required. Jury rigging a quick contraption in a minute with a practical function and purpose could net you as much as 15% of your mana capacity. A long project that takes 4 hours could be a full restore, or 5 minutes with high skill, value, and risk of failure. Major projects taking a week to build can double their capacity for a week.

### Perk
- Cost: 15

The mastery of a Gnome genius, an inventor’s spirit comparable to fictional mad scientists.

You use engineering to replicate in a limited capacity, the effects of any magic effect of any Magic Specialization. Rank 1 takes 1 hour of work, 8 for R2, 24 for R3, 1 week for R4, and 1 month for R5, involving components of comparable rarity to a Potion of its rank. Instantaneous / non durational effects have a 25% failure chance, and each failure has a 50% chance to destroy the device. You can repair a destroyed device in 1/10th the time. Duration / continuous based magics have this fail chance at every 24 hours of total activity. Gadgetry can be replicated without fail chance. Can have a tiny cockpit to operate Power Armor.

(Or a Golem made with Hexes, or Franken body made with Necromancy.)


## Race: Pixie
- Elements: Nature, Wind
- Mana capacity: Low
- Mana rate: High

Pixies are fae related to the Sprites, associated with plants where Sprites are associated with a manner of animal life. They can have wings like a sprite, or they can have leafy wings in any shape or color a leaf can have, though it may be thin to the point of transparency. Otherwise, pixies look like humans, elves, or dwarves but on a tiny scale, standing around an inch tall. They have a dryad-like ability to take on the form of any flower they’ve planted that has bloomed, and the ability to take pollens, seeds, or related traces of any two different flowers to breed a hybrid flower. Pixies flatly do not age, they merely grow from a baby size, to their adult size of around an inch. A slain pixie can be reborn from any flower they have planted.

__Pixies draw Mana__ from Blooming, whenever a flower created by the pixie blooms or a flower that the pixie has slept in the petals of, blooms then the pixie receives mana. As such, pixies tend to manage gardens of many different types of flowers, or in the wild range far to claim or plant them in fields or forests.

### Perk
- Cost: 3

Notable pixies are capable of generating pixie dust with their wings, a flap of their wings with intention to do so can release a pinch of pixie dust, well a pinch compared to a full size humanoid.

- On Animals of sub-human intelligence, this lets the pixie issue commands that it will follow for up to 1 week.
- On Plants, this causes an instantaneous bloom so long as. the plant is mature enough to do so, or invigorates the plant allowing it to grow 200% above normal, with 200% larger fruits or vegetables, etc.
- On Humans or animals of equal or greater intelligence, this induces sleep unless they match the pixie’s own rank (Measured in highest rank effect they can manage). Considered magic.


## Race: Fairy
- Elements: Soul, Mind
- Mana capacity: High
- Mana rate: Low

Fairies are fae related to the Sprites, but without either the flora or fauna association. They can have wings like a sprite, or they can have wafer wings of light transparent or opaque, that can emit a faint glow or light like a torch obscuring the fairy’s body. Otherwise, fairies look like humans, elves, or dwarves but on a tiny scale, standing around an inch tall. Fairies have the ability to on touch induce euphoria and bliss in creatures, filling them up with either a happiness that compels them to dance and sing, or a carnal impulse that compels. them to indulge vices of the body. Creatures so affected are temporally locked with no sense of time, and don’t age. Fairies flatly do not age, they merely grow from a baby size, to their adult size of around an inch. A slain fairy can reincarnate at any still ongoing revelry they started.

__Fairies draw Mana__ from revelry, whenever a creature of human intelligence or greater is locked in a fairy’s revelry, they gain charge over time. 1 human in revelry for 8 hours will charge a fairy’s mana capacity by around 25%. They stack.

### Perk
- Cost: 10

Especially potent fairies that tend to manage local groups of fairies, or rise to become fairy princesses or fairy queens. These fairies are able to grow Fairy Rings, rings of mushrooms or flowers, that establish a domain-like space that those outside cannot see into, which may also be a gate through time to a unique timespace similar to time what a pocket dimension is to space. In this timespace, the fairy can dictate how much time passes relative to outside but only to slow it, so 1 day inside was as much as a year outside of it, or speed it so 1 hour inside was half an hour outside. The fairy can reverse time within the timespace, but it’s only physical, and time is still flowing forward normally, minds are unchanged. The timespace is only the size of the fairy ring created, leaving the fairy ring leaves the timespace. If the fairy has Portals, their fairy rings can act as gateways to any other fairy ring known to the one who enters.


## Race: Genie
- Elements: All
- Mana capacity: High
- Mana rate: Low

Genies are avatars of raw magic. They have the [???] type, meaning [???] types are double discounted and rounded down. All Genies then can pick any one affinity as their secondary type which heavily influences their appearance in spirit form. Their spirit form looking like a humanoid elemental of their chosen type from 1 inch to 30f tall. All genies then have a physical form based on any other witch race, as though using Hybridize to acquire it, but they can’t gain the type perks or their form of cheating death. Genies all have rank 2 in every core & faction magic, and Prestidigitation & Conjuration free, used personally, not via Mammon, & costs nothing if used to satisfy a Master’s wish Genies do not age. A slain genie returns to her Vessel, see type perk.

__Genies draw Mana__ from Wishes, whenever any person says "I wish", and the genie is capable of satisfying that wish with her available abilities, the genie gains a low mana charge for the next hour. If her master is the one to wish, she gains her full mana capacity for meeting the wish.

### Perk
- Cost: -5

All genies require this type perk. Genies have a Vessel, an invulnerable artifact between the size of a baseball, up to the size of an urn, it can change its appearance. It must appear opulent and valuable. If the Genie has Witchery, the pocketspace exists within this Vessel and with or without Witchery, the pocketspace is where she appears when banished to or simply returning to her lamp with a visible effect. As the vessel IS the pocket space, it cannot be stored within itself or in any other form of extradimensional space.

A Genie cannot be more than 300m away from their vessel The last non-witch to touch the vessel becomes the Genie’s Master, who cannot be disobeyed (But can be argued with for a few seconds), the genie cannot cause the master harm. The master can choose the genie’s appearance and race type, when outside her vessel.


## Race: Gemini
- Elements: Earth
- Mana capacity: High
- Mana rate: Low

Gemini are split soul beings that inhabit two bodies as one synchronous whole. The bodies are always nearly identical. Geminai have bodies composed of an associated gem associated with an Affinity, ruby fire affinity for example. Each of the pair have a different gem. This gem influences the coloration of parts of their body besides their skin, though they can have gem protrusions through their skin, which is still soft like flesh on the surface. Each half of the Gemini spends Power separately on its own effects, evenly splitting their power total between them. Gemini are born looking around 8 and age 1 year per 10 for around 80-120 years before they stop aging entirely.

A dead Gemini half will fade into stardust, but will reappear when the surviving half sleeps, waking in the other half’s arms.

__Geminai draw Mana__ from Pairing, the more in synch the two halves are in mind, intent, and appearance, the more mana they generate proportional to distance to each other. They feel this charge rate and are uncomfortable when it is weakened.

### Perk
- Cost: 4

Geminai with this type perk have even stronger bonds, capable of trading their consciousness and their half of their soul to trade places between their Egos (however minimal or great they may be divergent), or they can swap entirely as though teleporting. Gemini share a mental bond to feel the other’s emotional state, senses, & intention such that they can act as a whole, or they can fully communicate telepathically, each hearing the mental dialogue of the other if they “raise their voice”, or both parties can tighten the connection to hear their passive internal dialogue entirely as though speaking out loud to oneself near the other.

Nothing can sever this connection, short of death.
