## Race: Vargr
- Elements: Beast, Soul
- Mana capacity: High
- Mana rate: Medium

An ancient lineage of witch descended from monstrous sun-and-moon devouring wolves. A Vargr has some degree of lupine traits along with the strength and endurance of a Daeva. They age like Jotun though if slain re-awaken the next full moon in a new mortal host. If killed via silver then it takes a full decade for them to return.

__Vargr draw Mana__ from Trophies which are taken from entities that the Vargr has personally slain. The greater their strength then the more mana is gained from the trophy before needing to replace it. A Vargr gains medium charge from being in proximity to their trophies. This degrades to a low charge when at a distance. It can be circumvented by wearing a trophy, i.e. a bone necklace for example, to maintain a medium charge. Some Vargr get creative with Aberrant or Necromancy...

### Perk
- Cost: 10

You can transmute the trophies you take into symbolic tattoos which can be placed on yourself or others. These ‘trophy-tattoos’ only provide a low charge when placed on yourself, however they may be expended to summon a duplicate of the entity used to create the ‘trophy-tattoo’. These duplicates have their full abilities and personality but not memories. They are under your complete control but only last for up to 6 hours. For [15], also become a Werewolf from Simple Costume Party [https://i.redd.it/79jq7kp2dvw71.png] with The Pack event and all Werewolf synergies. You may retain control even on the full moon. Any werewolves you create also have this ability though they have only half your strength and are limited in their ability to infect others. Any werewolves you create only gains 3 synergies at most which they will receive over time.
