## Magic: Body Refinement
- Class: Academic
- Elements: Body, Nature, Mind

An old, old magical practice centered around refining the vessel of the soul itself into a mystical treasure. This is done through the circulation of magic through one's body in conjunction with the ingestion of various increasingly expensive elixirs. As a result you will gain innate abilities similar to those found in Relics.

### Rank 1
At this point you're merely strengthening your body for what is to come. If you should be injured then so long as the wound is able to heal naturally on its own then it will do without complication or scarring. In addition you don't actually need mundane food and water any longer to survive. This naturally doesn't apply to supernatural requirements for sustenance such as an Empusa's need for blood. To progress to the next stage you must cycle your magic while consuming elixirs whose cost is equal to [K]1,000 in Alchemy ingredients of Rank 2

### Rank 2
At this stage your body has achieved some minor success in being refined. You gain a refinement pool with an equivalent to K100,000 that refreshes each month with no carryover. It may be used to pay the monetary requirements of a spell of Rank 1 or lower. This would include for example but is not limited to Hexes and Portals. Or, it may be substituted as a Rank 1 ingredient for Potions and Runes. The way in which it is expressed is unique to the witch herself with some favoring literally offering up their flesh and blood while others have less grisly methods. To progress to the next stage elixirs whose cost is equal to [K]10,000 in Alchemy ingredients of Rank 3 are needed.

### Rank 3
Your refinement pool has increased to [K]200,000. It may be used to pay the monetary requirements of Rank 3 spells. Or, substitute for Rank 2 ingredients. Having reached this point your body has begun to become a treasure itself with it acquiring one or more innate abilities. You now have 5 Reward Points to spend on Relics to represent this. Feel free to make adjustments as to how these abilities are expressed given that they're now innate physical or spiritual capabilities rather than external tools. To progress to the next stage elixirs whose cost is equal to [K]100,000 in Alchemy ingredients of Rank 4 are needed.

### Rank 4
Your refinement pool has increased to [K]300,000. It may be used to pay the monetary requirements of Rank 4 spells. Or, substitute for Rank 3 ingredients. You now have an additional 5 Reward Points to spend on Relics. If desired you may refund your previous choices which would leave you with a total of 10 Reward Points to spend. To progress to the next stage elixirs whose cost is equal to [K]1,000,000 in Alchemy ingredients of Rank 5 are needed.

### Rank 5
Your 'refinement pool' has increased to [K]500,000. It may be used to pay the monetary requirements of Rank 5 spells. Or, substitute for Rank 4 ingredients. You now have an additional 5 Reward Points to spend on Relics. If desired you may refund your previous choices which would leave you with a total of {15} Reward Points to spend. It is possible to revise your selection after this point but requires 1 month per Reward Point therefore switching to a different {5} Relic would take 5 months. While this change is occurring you would not have access to either of their abilities.
