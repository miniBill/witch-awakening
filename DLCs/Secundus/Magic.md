## Magic: Body Refinement
- Class: Academic
- Elements: Body, Nature, Mind

An old, old magical practice centered around refining the vessel of the soul itself into a mystical treasure. This is done through the circulation of magic through one’s body in conjunction with the ingestion of various increasingly expensive elixirs. As a result you will gain innate abilities similar to those found in Relics.

### Rank 1
At this point you’re merely strengthening your body for what is to come. If you should be injured then so long as the wound is able to heal naturally on its own then it will do without complication or scarring. In addition you don’t actually need mundane food and water any longer to survive. This naturally doesn’t apply to supernatural requirements for sustenance such as an Empusa’s need for blood. To progress to the next stage you must cycle your magic while consuming elixirs whose cost is equal to [K]1,000 in Alchemy ingredients of Rank 2

### Rank 2
At this stage your body has achieved some minor success in being refined. You gain a refinement pool with an equivalent to K100,000 that refreshes each month with no carryover. It may be used to pay the monetary requirements of a spell of Rank 1 or lower. This would include for example but is not limited to Hexes and Portals. Or, it may be substituted as a Rank 1 ingredient for Potions and Runes. The way in which it is expressed is unique to the witch herself with some favoring literally offering up their flesh and blood while others have less grisly methods. To progress to the next stage elixirs whose cost is equal to [K]10,000 in Alchemy ingredients of Rank 3 are needed.

### Rank 3
Your refinement pool has increased to [K]200,000. It may be used to pay the monetary requirements of Rank 3 spells. Or, substitute for Rank 2 ingredients. Having reached this point your body has begun to become a treasure itself with it acquiring one or more innate abilities. You now have {5} Reward Points to spend on Relics to represent this. Feel free to make adjustments as to how these abilities are expressed given that they’re now innate physical or spiritual capabilities rather than external tools. To progress to the next stage elixirs whose cost is equal to [K]100,000 in Alchemy ingredients of Rank 4 are needed.

### Rank 4
Your refinement pool has increased to [K]300,000. It may be used to pay the monetary requirements of Rank 4 spells. Or, substitute for Rank 3 ingredients. You now have an additional {5} Reward Points to spend on Relics. If desired you may refund your previous choices which would leave you with a total of {10} Reward Points to spend. To progress to the next stage elixirs whose cost is equal to [K]1,000,000 in Alchemy ingredients of Rank 5 are needed.

### Rank 5
Your refinement pool has increased to [K]500,000. It may be used to pay the monetary requirements of Rank 5 spells. Or, substitute for Rank 4 ingredients. You now have an additional 5 Reward Points to spend on Relics. If desired you may refund your previous choices which would leave you with a total of {15} Reward Points to spend. It is possible to revise your selection after this point but requires 1 month per Reward Point therefore switching to a different {5} Relic would take 5 months. While this change is occurring you would not have access to either of their abilities.


## Magic: Spirit Puppetry
- Class: Sorceress
- Elements: Life, Mind, Soul

Spirit Puppetry is the art of forming spells into ‘artificial construct entities’ that are manifested in the form of simple physical vessels. Most often this is in the form of paper dolls or origami as they’re easy to conceptualize but there are other potential expressions. Unlike with Golemancy for example spirit puppets are by nature inherently disposable. Indeed their true power can only be used by sacrificing them to manifest the spell they were created from. You still have to actually know the spell along with an expenditure of mana to create the spirit puppet.

### Rank 1
To begin with you can sustain up to 6 lesser puppets with strength equivalent to that of a large dog. You must include a Rank 1 spell in their construction which will activate upon the lesser puppet sacrificing itself. It takes about 10 minutes to create a single lesser spirit puppet. In the case of potions it functions as it does with Spellbinding for Curses.

### Rank 2
At this stage you can sustain up to 12 lesser puppets and 6 minor puppets who have the strength of an olympic athlete. A spell of Rank 2 or lower must be included when forming a minor puppet. You can now form a  	‘false shell’ around your spirit puppets to modify their appearance to your preference. They are able to perform simple tasks such as household chores or similar though anything beyond basic instructions is beyond them. A witch would be able to easily see through this at a glance however. It takes about 20 minutes to create a single minor spirit puppet.

### Rank 3
You can sustain up to 24 lesser puppets, 12 minor puppets, and 6 standard puppets who each have the strength of a bear. A spell of Rank 3 or lower must be included when forming a standard puppet. You are also able to summon your puppets to your side with a thought or return them to where you had summoned them from. It takes 30 minutes to create a single standard spirit puppet.

### Rank 4
You can sustain up to 36 lesser puppets, 18 minor puppets, 12 standard puppets, and 3 greater puppets with strength equivalent to that of an elephant. A spell of Rank 4 or lower must be included when forming a greater puppet. Your spirit puppets now have intelligence equivalent to that of an average human allowing them to carry out complex tasks and plans of their own initiative. It takes 1 hour to create a greater puppet.

### Rank 5
You can sustain up to 42 lesser puppets, 24 minor puppets, 18 standard puppets, 6 greater puppets, and 3 epic puppets which have strength equivalent to that of dire beasts. A spell of Rank 5 or lower must be included when forming an epic puppet. At this point multiple puppets may be merged together creating one or more composite ‘grand puppets’ with the aggregate health, durability, strength, and intelligence of all puppets included in their creation. It may still sacrifice the puppets composing itself to cast the spells bound to them but will be weakened from losing that part. It takes 24 hours to create an epic puppet.
