_Requires Curses 1+_

For a small amount of additional effort you are able to tie your curses to the very bloodline of those you target. All those descended from that initial individual will in turn inherit the original curse you placed on them and so on and so forth. This ' bloodline curse' can last up to the 13th generation after which you will need to 'refresh' it should you desire for it to continue. As like with other curses you may establish Conditions if desired.
