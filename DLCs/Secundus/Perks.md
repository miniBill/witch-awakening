## Perk: Greater Dragon
- Class: Warlock
- Element: Beast
- Meta: True
- Requires: Metamorphosis (Dragon)
- Cost: 25

You are a thing seldom seen: A Greater Dragon. Play through Dragonfall by Tok'Haar Gol. Some choices may be redundant with Witch Awakening.

Initially, your draconic form is roughly equivalent to that of Metamorphosis (Dragon) in terms of power. However with time and practice you’ll eventually achieve the full extent of your capabilities as you grow. At this point you may switch your True Form to that of the Greater Dragon. This inverts the function of Metamorphosis (Dragon) instead allowing you to take on the form of your previous Witch species.

You may take Companions and Pacts from Dragonfall. Adjust as needed.


## Perk: Lavender Exaltation
- Class: Warlock
- Element: Life
- Meta: True
- Cost: 25

The Holder of Three Thrones having donned the Lavender Regalia demands another Bride. Demands you. So it shall be that you will become the newest of the Lavender Brides. Play through the Lavender CYOA (NSFW) by EDG.

To be a Lavender Bride is both a blessing and burden. No longer are you yet another mere mortal however in return you’ve been inextricably bound to an inhuman deity. Where shall you go from here?

If you choose to stay on Earth just keep in mind that you are still bound by the Masquerade.


## Perk: The Mask
- Class: Warlock
- Element: Soul
- Meta: True
- Cost: 15

One night you will be visited by the Mask Maker as many others have been. He's a powerful, enigmatic figure who will craft a special mask just for you. Play through the Mask Maker.

A Wooden Mask requires Rank 3+ Magic to damage, the Spirit Mask requires Rank 4+, and the Stone Mask requires Rank 5+. Another individual with a Mask is able to ignore the Magic 4+ requirement to damage a Spirit Mask so long as they use the abilities from their mask.

Asa a Witch you may repair your mask if its damaged or broken. This will require roughly equivalent of a Heroic Quest which can be taken for free as many times as needed.


## Perk: Beast Fodder
- Class: Sorceress
- Element: Soul
- Requires: Witchery 5
- Cost: 5

Unlike many other witches you are able to attune non-sapient plants and animals to your pocket dimension. This allows for them to be able to survive off of the false matter creations while in your pocket dimension. If they have magic requirements for their survival such as the Golden Fish for example then you won’t be able to substitute false matter creations in their place. It requires [K]10.000 in Rank 4 ingredients per animal or plant be expended to attune them and any resulting offspring they have will also inherit this trait though only for that specific pocket dimension. 
This is specific to your pocket dimension however you may perform this on another witch’s behalf in their pocket dimension at triple the cost. 


## Perk: Cursed Lineage
- Class: Warlock
- Element: Blood
- Requires: Curses 1+
- Cost: 7

For a small amount of additional effort you are able to tie your curses to the very bloodline of those you target. All those descended from that initial individual will in turn inherit the original curse you placed on them and so on and so forth. This ‘bloodline curse’ can last up to the 13th generation after which you will need to ‘refresh’ it should you desire for it to continue. As like with other curses you may establish Conditions if desired.
