## Perk: Greater Dragon
- Class: Warlock
- Element: Beast
- Meta: True
- Cost: 25

_Requires Metamorphosis (Dragon)_

You are a thing seldom seen: A Greater Dragon. Play through Dragonfall by Tok'Haar Gol. Some choices may be redundant with Witch Awakening.

Initially, your draconic form is roughly equivalent to that of Metamorphosis (Dragon) in terms of power. However with time and practice you'll eventually achieve the full extent of your capabilities as you grow. At this point you may switch your True Form to that of the Greater Dragon. This inverts the function of Metamorphosis (Dragon) instead allowing you to take on the form of your previous Witch species.

You may take Companions and Pacts from Dragonfall. Adjust as needed.


## Perk: Lavender Exaltation
- Class: Warlock
- Element: Life
- Meta: True
- Cost: 25

The Holder of Three Thrones having donned the Lavender Regalia demands another Bride. Demands you. So it shall be that you will become the newest of the Lavender Brides. Play through the Lavender CYOA (NSFW) by EDG.

To be a Lavender Bride is both a blessing and burden. No longer are you yet another mere mortal however in return you've been inextricably bound to an inhuman deity. Where shall you go from here?

If you choose to stay on Earth just keep in mind that you are still bound by the Masquerade.


## Perk: Cursed Lineage
- Class: Warlock
- Element: Blood
- Cost: 7

_Requires Curses 1+_

For a small amount of additional effort you are able to tie your curses to the very bloodline of those you target. All those descended from that initial individual will in turn inherit the original curse you placed on them and so on and so forth. This ' bloodline curse' can last up to the 13th generation after which you will need to 'refresh' it should you desire for it to continue. As like with other curses you may establish Conditions if desired.
