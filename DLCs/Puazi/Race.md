# Puazi


## Race: Puazi

Puazi are a humanoid alien species. They have horizontal pupils, horns and tails, reminiscent of earth deers. Their skin is orange, with brown fur patterns and blue accents. They have lighter bones, making them more fragile than humans but also giving them incredible dexterity and speed, being able to outrun anyone but Olympic athletes. They age comparably to humans, but Puazi witches benefit from slowed aging compared to baseline, at about half the speed. They tend to be very attractive, and a lot of them present very femme, regardless of their gender or sex.

Their families and relationships tend to be larger and more fluid than most races, naturally forming big polycules, although the rare monogamous Puazi do exist. Puazi find human pheromones incredibly enticing, making them go into heat unless they regularly take a specific (but widely available) medication for that.

A dead Puazi can be reborn if someone who carries as precious an intimate moment they shared decides they want to bear them. The child will be born with all the memories and magic of the dead witch, and grow up at an accelerated rate.

__Puazi draw Mana__ from Intimacy, the shared vulnerability of people sharing something deep about them. Physical intimacy is very effective at recharging them, especially if it involves sharing of fluids, but emotional intimacy can be almost as effective, and listening to a close friend pouring her heart out can fully recharge a Puazi in the time it takes to share the secret.

You gain the ability to intuitively perceive the emotions of people around you, even if theyâ€™re trying to hide them. Your range is usually a couple meters, and you need line of sight, but you can detect stronger emotions from further apart, and emotions about you in particular even through obstacles.

In addition, for people that you are intimate with, you can send and receive emotions over long distances. By default this has a range of several kilometers, and scales up with the intensity of the emotion and how emotionally and physically close you are to the person. As opposed to the passive perception of people next to you, communicating emotions long range is always a voluntary action, initiated from the sender.
