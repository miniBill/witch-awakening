## Race: Cantor
- Elements: Body, Wind
- Mana capacity: Low
- Mana rate: High

Cantors look a lot like humans but with blue skin and similar lifespan. The mysterious alien race was summoned to Earth as part of a complex centuries-long soul-harvest scheme by a demonic cult. The evil plans were foiled by O.R.C. and tentative diplomatic contact was established. They are extremely secretive and only call their home planet “Five” and most don’t know where it is in relation to Earth, and those who do don’t tell. Most witches of this race you find are actually awakened Earthlings. No, Elvis was not one of them.

__Cantors draw Mana__ from Singing, The greater the performance’s skill and the more emotion they put into the song, the faster the charge. Simply humming produces a small trickle of mana, while a masterfully executed original composition about a personally important topic can fully charge one of them in a minute. This requires the use of vocal apparatus or blowing wind instruments. Playing non-wind instruments, dancing and singing in groups helps indirectly.

Gain the [Soul] affinity and also gain mana when people listen to your songs, either from live performances (the strongest, and you still gain mana from singing yourself), your own original compositions (mid), and recordings of your works (weaker, much more so with distance). The mana increases the larger the audience, with diminishing returns (five people give twice as much mana as a single person, 25 give three times as much mana, 125 gives x4, and so on).


## Race: Gargoyle
- Elements: Earth, Wind
- Mana capacity: Medium
- Mana rate: Medium

A race of winged humanoids with a fearsome almost demonic appearance and a peculiar trait: they turn into stone when the sun rises, and revert to flesh when it sets. Being exposed to sunlight during “stone sleep” nourishes and heals them, saving them from even the brink of death. Waking up from stone sleep has a chance to shrug off magic effects, always working against petrification. Transformation Sequence prevents stone sleep if done before the sun rises. Technically, their wings to glide, but their powerful claws allow them to climb the side of buildings/cliffs to throw themselves from higher ground.

__Gargoyles draw Mana__ from Protection. Gargoyles gain a trickle of mana when standing guard during the night, with higher charges when actively protecting or rescuing someone. Stronger when the protection is mutualistic, either from working together during battle, protecting the clan’s young and elders (who will take care of you / have taken care of you), or from relationships with other intelligent species that can protect the Gargoyles during the day.

Your stone-sleep may turn you into something other than gray stone, like white marble, crystal quartz, glass, hard clay, or even another non-precious material if you have a non-Earth affinity (Ice for Water, Wood for Nature, etc.). Regardless of material, the gargoyle is now extraordinarily durable during stone sleep and can only be harmed by magics of R3 or higher. They may extend this protection to other sleeping gargoyles in their vicinity (up to 100ft). While still turning into stone during the day, the Gargoyle gains the power to do so at will during the night, shifting between states in seconds for uses including, but not limited to: partially transforming to shield oneself, petrifying wounds to stop bleeding, or just hardening claws.


## Race: Aquarian
- Elements: Wind, Water
- Mana capacity: High
- Mana rate: Medium

Alien species that claims to be native to a distant gas giant. They have the innate ability to float and fly in the air, but this is ten times more tiring than walking at a comparable speed. They have the ability to evaporate water and control the subsequent mist. This may be used to simulate the winds of R1 Windkeeping (but not other abilities and benefits), the mist may be turned back into water as a light localized rain. Drinking their own rainwater keeps them young, and drinking a lot of it rejuvenates them.

__Aquarians draw Mana__ from Hydration. When they quench the thirst of other living beings using water from their rains. Like many methods, this is stronger when used on people and even more so with other witches, but watering a garden also works. A stronger thirst provides a higher charge rate, but not more total mana than regularly hydrating. You can incorporate your rainwater into other things such as beverages and or even food.

You gain the ability to produce Light Nectar, a sweet, nutritious substance made out of your rainwater and light woven between your fingers. It works like making a Rank 3 Curative Potion, with different colors of Light Nectar having different curative effects. It does not require a cauldron, only water, light and mana. If you have ranks in Alchemy, you may brew other potions this way too, by evaporating the liquids from the ingredients into mist.
