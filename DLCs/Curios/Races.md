## Race: Cantor

Cantors look a lot like humans but with blue skin and similar lifespan. The mysterious alien race was summoned to Earth as part of a complex centuries-long soul-harvest scheme by a demonic cult. The evil plans were foiled by O.R.C. and tentative diplomatic contact was established. They are extremely secretive and only call their home planet “Five” and most don’t know where it is in relation to Earth, and those who do don’t tell. Most witches of this race you find are actually awakened Earthlings. No, Elvis was not one of them. 

__Cantors draw Mana__ from Singing, The greater the performance’s skill and the more emotion they put into the song, the faster the charge. Simply humming produces a small trickle of mana, while a masterfully executed original composition about a personally important topic can fully charge one of them in a minute. This requires the use of vocal apparatus or blowing wind instruments. Playing non-wind instruments, dancing and singing in groups helps indirectly.

### Perk
- Cost: 5

Gain the [Soul] affinity and also gain mana when people listen to your songs, either from live performances (the strongest, and you still gain mana from singing yourself), your own original compositions (mid), and recordings of your works (weaker, much more so with distance). The mana increases the larger the audience, with diminishing returns (five people give twice as much mana as a single person, 25 give three times as much mana, 125 gives x4, and so on).
