## Perk: Mana Berry
- Element: Nature
- Class: Warlock
- Cost: 4

This ability used to be really common in the faewild. It works similar to minting Witch Kisses, but producing small glowing berries instead of coins. You obtain 2d6 Mana berries after a ten minute ritual meditation, plus 2d6 berries for each additional ten minutes spent, as long as you have the mana. Eating one of those berries is like tapping into a Witch Kiss, but additionally restores a very small amount of your health (roughly healing the equivalent of a papercut per berry) and way more filling than their grape-size would imply, with just three  or four of them being enough to count as a meal for a full grown adult, but with no issues from overeating more than that. The downside - and the reason they fell out of favor - is that mana berries rot after 1d6 days, making them much less useful to store mana in the long term, and only showing signs when that happens by slowly going dim twelve hours before quickly rotting and turning to dust.


## Perk: The Marshmallow Test
- Element: Mind
- Class: Academic
- Cost: 4

From the moment you acquire this perk you gain Focus/Might/Favor twice as fast… until you actually use those on any power or reward points, meaning that you can stockpile Focus/Might/Favor and even use them on a temporary ranked magic boost, but the moment you convert Focus/Might/Favor or even Reward Points into Power points you lose the boost this perk gives you. You also may still spend Reward Points from Quests on Relics and Companions.


## Perk: Slow Acting Potion
- Element: Body
- Class: Academic 
- Requires: Alchemy 2+
- Cost: 3

The typical potion acts nearly instantaneously upon consumption. Some effects can be delayed, even by using relatively mundane methods like reducing it to a pill and coating the pill with something that takes long to dissolve. However, this perk lets you decide during potion creation how long it takes to activate. Up to a _maximum_ number of days three times your ranks in Alchemy. But you can be any amount below that, timed down to the minute. Delayed potions are considered one rank higher than normal. You may additionally give it a trigger condition that activates it instead, the trigger must be some kind of chemical to react to, anything from drunk milk, a specific poison, dying flesh (to activate it upon death) or even another potion. A potion that does not trigger just leaves the organism without effect. People are weary of this perk, either because of pranks or darker applications.
