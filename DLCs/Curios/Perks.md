## Perk: Mana Berry
- Element: Nature
- Class: Warlock
- Cost: 4

This ability used to be really common in the faewild. It works similar to minting Witch Kisses, but producing small glowing berries instead of coins. You obtain 2d6 Mana berries after a ten minute ritual meditation, plus 2d6 berries for each additional ten minutes spent, as long as you have the mana. Eating one of those berries is like tapping into a Witch Kiss, but additionally restores a very small amount of your health (roughly healing the equivalent of a papercut per berry) and way more filling than their grape-size would imply, with just three  or four of them being enough to count as a meal for a full grown adult, but with no issues from overeating more than that. The downside - and the reason they fell out of favor - is that mana berries rot after 1d6 days, making them much less useful to store mana in the long term, and only showing signs when that happens by slowly going dim twelve hours before quickly rotting and turning to dust.
