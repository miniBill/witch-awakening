## Relic: Time-Saver Pendant
- Class: Academic
- Cost: 2

This is a small hourglass-shaped pendant and chain. Wearing it around your neck causes time to flow between 1% to 12% slower to you (adjusted by rotating the top tighter or looser). Why? The “lost” time is converted into magic sand that you can pour out and add to any magical crafting process to reduce the process by that amount. Additionally, you gain an uncanny sense of time and how different time flows relate to each other, and the ability to portion ingredients without measurement equipment. For reference, an entire 24 hours of wearing this at 1% grants 14 minutes and 24 seconds.
