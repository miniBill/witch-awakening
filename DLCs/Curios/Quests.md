## Quest: Witches Got Talent
- Slot: Folk
- Evil Route: True
- Threat: 2
- Conflict: 2
- Reward: 3

Arcadia is organizing a talent show! There are multiple categories: Music, Dance, Magic Performances, Crafts, Cuisine, Misc. Talents. It's not limited to only their students. And anyone can enjoy the fun! This is a fun opportunity to socialize and enjoy yourself and see amazing displays of talent.

Notes:
+ The competitions are about skill and not just raw magic, the subcategories are arranged accordingly. Some are even magic free.
+ You can participate in the competition yourself or in a support role. Maybe even be as a judge.
+ Great opportunity to meet a companion.
+ Obvious Evil Route is to sabotage competitors, but you may use the opportunity to infiltrate Arcadia, maybe orchestrate a heist. The event itself is well guarded by Watchers, but they can’t be everywhere.
+ You can flavor the reward points as the winning prize.

Some “Mr. X” hired you to help with a very unusual request: Take an ancient castle apart, transport the pieces across the ocean, and then rebuild it at the top of a Skyscraper. Honestly, this is mostly a _busy_ job than a dangerous job.

Notes:
+ You are allowed to use any relevant magic in discreet ways. Or even non-magical skills.
+ Mr. X is actually pretty chill, but one of those Narcissists types that will say every setback helps a secondary goal.
+ ORC might come around asking questions about what sort of curse or prophecy Mr. X is working here.
+ You won’t actually be told what is the purpose of the entire thing. But you can try to find out (come up with something, ORC is probably right that it is a curse or prophecy). Be careful not to be caught.
+ Mr. X's Assistant is some kind of disguised magical being and watches everyone closely.


## Quest: Watchers in the Outfield
- Slot: Folk
- Faction: The Watchers
- Evil Route: False
- Threat: 1
- Conflict: 1
- Reward: 2
A mortal child has been praying to win an upcoming competition. Pretty normal. The weird part is that a high level celestial issued an order to answer those prayers, with cryptic warnings saying this is important. Despite that, the quest is not very dangerous or difficult.

Notes
+ You are free to pick any sport or game, and also why the child is so invested in winning.
+ The child is not directly connected to the magical world and _currently_ has no powers. You can come up with a reason for them to be important. Maybe they show up on a later quest to help you? Maybe as a custom companion?
+ You have a lot of discretion on how to go about this quest. You could tell the child about the witch world, and use your magic to let them win. Just don’t cause harm to innocents or cause a masquerade violation.
+ Of course, there is probably some moral lesson that can be shoehorned here, just ignore the unfairness of a single kid receiving literal divine help for their game. Maybe the real victory is the friends we made along the way.
