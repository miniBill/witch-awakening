Notes:
+ The competitions are about skill and not just raw magic, the subcategories are arranged accordingly. Some are even magic free.
+ You can participate in the competition yourself or in a support role. Maybe even be as a judge. 
+ Great opportunity to meet a companion.
+ Obvious Evil Route is to sabotage competitors, but you may use the opportunity to infiltrate Arcadia, maybe orchestrate a heist. The event itself is well guarded by Watchers, but they canâ€™t be everywhere.
