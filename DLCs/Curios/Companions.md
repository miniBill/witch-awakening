An Aquarian that immigrated to Earth to both teach and learn more about the “Arts of Elemental Harmonics”. She is herself favors “Climatic” Elementalism - a combination of Wind, Water and Fire - and also knows a lot about mundane meteorology. She teaches classes in Intro Elementalism, Intro and Intermediate Harmonics, Advanced Climatic Elementalism, and a self-control class for students with Mood Weather. Initially, she worked at Hawthorne, but missed the sky and greatly disliked the disciplinarian culture.
