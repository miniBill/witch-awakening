# Elemental Harmony

## Race: Phlegethon
- Elements: Fire, Blood
- Mana capacity: Medium
- Mana rate: Medium

In a desert, Phlegethontes look entirely human. In humid places, though, their skin steams softly, and in the cold, their flesh gradually goes clear, showing their veins, which seem to flow with liquid fire, and their eye sockets, which have roaring candle flames behind the eyeballs. Cutting them releases the burning blood. They have a sixth sense for other people around them, the heat of their breath and beating of their blood standing out to a Phlegethon like a spotlight, though they can’t distinguish individuals well.

On death, the flames from their blood spread explosively, and cannot be quenched without magic. If the flames take a life, or an intact heart is fed into them, the Phlegethon will reconstitute themself.

__Phlegethontes draw Mana__ from Crowds. Phlegethontes charge when in the presence of many people. They can gain a trickle from as few as two others, but only reach their full rate when a half-dozen people are nearby. If there are two dozen mortals or a hundred witches or other magical people within a hundred foot radius, they charge at a High rate.

### Perk
- Cost: 4

Some Phlegethons learn to deliberately release a layer of their blood and keep it under control, acting as a sheath of boiling-hot mist which explodes into flames whenever it is struck. This doesn’t impede their senses or injure them.


## Race: Moorwalker
- Elements: Earth, Wind
- Mana capacity: Medium
- Mana rate: Low

Moorwalkers look like rough-hewn statues with edges worn soft by centuries of wind. When looking closely at them while they’re sitting still in calm air, a careful observer can notice that their hair, eyes, and fingernails are not all there - they’re translucent air. This is also noticeable with skin contact, where it will always feel like they ‘just missed you’ and a faint breeze will touch your skin. (For this reason they avoid handshakes with mortals, where the ‘missed’ feeling stands out.) Gusts of wind never seem to affect moorwalkers as much as things around them, though this is subtle until the winds reach gale force.

If there is ever no sapient person within ten miles of the spot a moorwalker died, or within ten miles of the largest piece of their bone remaining, they resurrect instantly on the spot.

__Moorwalkers draw Mana__ from Solitude. Moorwalkers gain mana only when at least one hundred feet from any other person. This increases if there are no animals either (bugs and smaller excepted), and with the distance - if a mile from any other people, production increases to Medium. However, this increase is negated if they’re not close to solid land and their rate gets even slower if not in atmosphere.

### Perk
- Cost: 2

A few Moorwalkers who have ventured into space or unusual realms have found that they slowly convert desolation into moor, bare stone and vacuum changing to moss and thin air, then soil and a full atmosphere. This takes years of their presence to complete, but can affect a very large area.


## Race: Phantasm
- Elements: Wind, Mind
- Mana capacity: High
- Mana rate: Medium

Phantasms are, in their natural state, completely invisible and intangible; a free-floating mind, not tethered to any physical form whatsoever. Even the air around them is completely permeable. For those who were born human, this tends to make them habitually touch-starved, especially before they get used to their aerokinesis and the tactile sense it can give them when they have mastered it enough to be automatic. Somewhat more difficult is mastering the art of creating a visual body with the shimmering of the air. This always leaves them looking ghostly, usually like a transparent image of (a slightly idealized version of) their mortal form, but it is largely an illusion.

Not even the vacuum of space is dangerous to a Phantasm; they have no physical form. At worst, direct attacks on their mind can render them comatose, at which point they become nigh-impossible to locate and therefore recover freely.

__Phantasms draw Mana__ from Voyeurism. Phantasms gain mana by observing events without the target’s knowledge. This charges faster if they are learning secrets that the one under observation would wish to protect.

### Perk
- Cost: 3

Talented or practiced Phantasms decouple their projected image from their ‘natural form’, and can manipulate it to take any shape or size, though it will remain translucent and keeping tactile sense requires that it stay approximately humanoid. It is possible that any Phantasm can learn this, but very few bother to try.


## Race: Golem
- Elements: Earth, Mind
- Mana capacity: High
- Mana rate: Low

A golem is a rock tricked into thinking. Unlike other thinking rocks such as computers, this is done by inscribing particular words on fine paper with magical ink, and forming a clay brain around them. Golems are not initially well defined, looking approximately like an artist’s posable figurine made of clay, but they can slowly shift their appearance, and most adult golems look like swarthy humans. They are extremely durable and resilient, and can shut off pain easily. The only damage which is truly serious is things which manage to damage the animating inscription. This normally requires destroying most of the golem’s head, which does not otherwise impair them.

If the animating scroll is destroyed, a golem ceases to function. Rewriting the scroll precisely, with a particular golem in mind, and placing it in a new clay body, will resuscitate the dead golem. If not quite correct, this may create a new person instead, or the golem may not animate.

__Golems draw Mana__ from Writing. Golems charge through the act of writing, cataloging facts and observations about the world. This must be hand-written, in ink on paper (including parchment, papyrus, etc.). The importance and relevance of the information is not important, but it must be true or believed to be true; fiction is not acceptable.

### Perk
- Cost: 4

Old golems, and occasionally talented youngsters, learn to change the material their body is made of, shifting to clay for mobility, granite for durability, or pumice for lightness, or grow obsidian ‘claws’. Metal is not possible without extensive other magic.


## Race: Muspel
- Elements: Earth, Fire
- Mana capacity: High
- Mana rate: High

Muspel are lava wrapped in stone wrapped in flesh, and must be careful not to move too quickly lest one of the layers rupture, which cause damage that can be healed quickly, but not instantly. Almost no external force can cause similar damage, even to the outermost layer; Muspel are monstrously tough, and only damage themselves because they are also monstrously strong. They have an affinity for the sun, always knowing precisely where it is relative to them, even at night; they find realms without a true sun, such as much of Alfheimr, very disconcerting.

Muspel whose core is destroyed slowly reform at the edges of the nearest active lava flow. It takes three days to form the stone layer, and three weeks for the flesh.

__Muspels draw Mana__ from Annihilation. Muspel gain mana when destroying all record of some knowledge. This can be trivial knowledge, as long as it is not new and is having its last record destroyed. Old Muspel make a habit of recording trivial facts such as series of die rolls, so that they may annihilate it a decade later to charge.

### Perk
- Cost: 2

Some Muspel are able to channel their inner flames and stone against each other, weakening them but allowing them to move more freely and so pass more easily for mortal. This also has the effect of improving their external skin’s resistance to heat, flames, and magma substantially, making a lava bath merely mildly inconvenient. If they’re seriously wounded, the same results occur regardless.


## Race: Dictum
- Elements: Mind, Metal
- Mana capacity: Medium
- Mana rate: Medium

When they Awake, Dicta look like metallic-ceramic composite androids of their previous form. They are not actually robotic or technological, but purely magical: their form is a symbolic reflection of immutable Order. As they age, their appearance changes at 10% the rate of humans, but they gradually grow larger, adding 1% of their current height per year. Their natural strength is merely a very fit human’s, but it grows proportionately to their body weight, so an old Dictum will be quite strong.

The changes of appearance with age are cosmetic, not impairing. If killed, after ten million seconds they will wake in a staging area on the border of the World of Order and Earth, at the age and size they were when they Awoke.

__Dicta draw Mana__ from Promises. The more often it comes up and the greater the impact, the more it charges passively. Breaking a promise drains a substantial fraction of its total production instantly, and decreases production for a long time.

### Perk
- Cost: 5

Some Dicta are Oathbrokers, able to make voluntary oaths between two other parties self-enforcing, with a curse befalling any party who breaks the oath. They choose the rank of Curse, maximum equal to the strongest specialization they possess, but if it exceeds their ranks in Curse they can’t control its details.


## Race: Qareen
- Elements: Fire, Water
- Mana capacity: Medium
- Mana rate: High

A Qareen is a very mutable being, usually imitating flesh and blood but fundamentally made of heat and mist, not solid. They are heavily influenced by primal Chaos, and harming them is difficult because the reaction of their body is inconsistent and unpredictable even to themselves. They have a natural affinity for illusion and shape-changing; since their natural form is inconsistent, they may as well direct the change to resemble someone else. They can never keep this up for long without other magic, though, as Qurana are naturally unstable.

If destroyed, a Qareen will awake in the borderlands of the World of Chaos and Earth some time later. 80% of the time this will be a year or less, but the duration is random.

__Qurana draw Mana__ from Risk. Whenever a Qareen puts something important to them at risk from random chance or natural forces (not from intentional harm from another person) they gain mana. The greater the importance the greater the charge. Whether or not the stakes are won or lost makes no difference; a lucky Qareen may gain a lot of mana without losing anything important.

### Perk
- Cost: 5

Some Qareen can gamble for more than just money, playing games where the players wager mana, magical potential, souls, names, or anything else they and the other players can establish shared understanding of. Must be agreed in advance and believed, or it won’t transfer.


## Race: Rusalka
- Elements: Necro, Water
- Mana capacity: Low
- Mana rate: High

Rusalki form in bodies of water, usually rivers, where much death has occurred. Opinions vary on whether they are forgetful ghosts in watery bodies or new souls anchored to death. Their hair is long, algae-covered, and perpetually growing, and cutting or styling it is physically painful to the rusalka. Rusalki have an intuitive sense for the greatest regrets and grievances of spirits around them, and can learn to sense these from the living as well. They cannot breed true without drowning the father, but their spontaneously generation is often near others.

A dead rusalka’s spirit migrates to the nearest fresh water, where it will regain physical form the next time someone drowns, consuming the soul of the drowned.

__Rusalki draw Mana__ from Hair. The longer and messier a rusalka‘s hair, the more quickly she will generate mana. A ponytail (the neatest that is painless) will generate a trickle if at least four feet long, as will a messy tangle cut to one foot; six feet of tangle is the ‘standard’ High level.

### Perk
- Cost: 4

Cursebearer rusalka can take on the grievance or regret of a spirit or living person (but must set down one if they wish to take up another). While enacting violence in fulfillment of that cause, their spells, particularly elementalism, curses, and hexes, are cheaper and more powerful.


## Race: Lares
- Elements: Blood, Life
- Mana capacity: Medium
- Mana rate: High

Also derogatorily called Brownies, Lares are the protector spirits of old families. Most Laral lineages originate with a very old family of Neutral witches, and in these cases at least some of the family remain associated with their originators and their homes. A Lar bonded to a family and residence passively repairs their surroundings by their presence, and has an extra sense that tells them when the building or family is damaged or in danger. Most have some talent for moving quickly that they use to come to the defense of their charges, and these are more effective than usual when they do.

A Lar who dies bonded will be roused back toward life every time a fire is lit in the home or family‘s hearth. A dozen or two fires will see them awakened, and they will appear the next night while the hearth is unobserved.

__Lares draw Mana__ from Maintenance. A Lar charges by taking care of chores and maintenance of a residence, particularly while unobserved. They can also charge from performing first aid and nonmagical medicine on their bonded family, but this is hard to do unobserved. While observed, their charge rate drops to Medium.

### Perk
- Cost: 3

Unusual Lares can teleport to anywhere within their bonded home, or to their bonded family if within five miles of home, and may be selectively invisible while in their bonded family’s presence or bonded home.


## Race: Firebird
- Elements: Fire, Beast
- Mana capacity: Medium
- Mana rate: High

Firebirds, or Phoenixes, are feathered all down their arms, back, and legs in shades of red and gold, and their arms have the structure and strength of real wings, though with careful clothing choice they can appear human to a casual inspection. They are not constantly aflame, but the faster they move, the more the feathers become flames. This generates natural thermals, so with their light bones, they can fly under their own power.

Of all natural methods of immortality, theirs is probably the hardest to foil. On death, they ignite and leave a torso-sized egg that will in a matter of days hatch into themself again, but if this egg is destroyed, it will reappear instantly elsewhere, appearing further and further away, and hatching faster and faster, if it is destroyed repeatedly. Even trapping them in stagnant time or petrification will not stick, causing them to temporarily shatter the effect in a burst of flame.

__Firebirds draw Mana__ from Conviction. Whether their own strong confidence in what they are doing, or the feeling of certain rightness in others, a phoenix charges when those near them or closely tied to them experience strong confidence in the moral rightness of their cause or actions. Whether those beliefs are correct is entirely irrelevant.

### Perk
- Cost: 6

‘True phoenixes’ can freely shapeshift to and from a pure bird form, about the size and shape of an eagle, which shares their flame effect. Additionally, they passively heal, and optionally calm and reassure, everyone in their presence, and gain an affinity for [Life].


## Race: Fresco
- Elements: Life, Soul
- Mana capacity: High
- Mana rate: Medium

Frescoes are one of the oddest races behind the Veil, because they are, for the most part, two-dimensional. They have limited telekinesis that provides a tactile sense and fills space, but even Fresco witches walking in public must wear cloaks made of a single large piece of cloth so that they can keep their body on the cloak and project out with telekinesis to fill the space under it and keep it supported in the correct shape for a human. Frescoes usually form from memories; reborn souls who either were present for widely-remembered events or who were remembered themselves. Positive memories are more likely to cause Frescoes, and far more likely to awaken as witches, with the weight of the collective good regard granting them their elemental affinities.

A Fresco is not dead while its origin is still remembered. To rebind it to the world, inscribe or illustrate the memory that formed it onto a wall; it will reshape itself into the form of the Fresco in a matter of hours.

__Frescoes draw Mana__ from Teaching. Whether leading a classroom, tutoring, or demonstrating a skill actively, Frescoes charge mana by imparting knowledge to others. Accuracy not required, but honesty is, and inattentive students charge slower.

### Perk
- Cost: 2

Some Frescoes have an intuition for the zeitgeist, and what history and fiction is popular both globally and in any local subcommunity. This doesn’t scale below a dozen or so and works better on mortal humans.


## Race: Silverstream
- Elements: Water, Metal
- Mana capacity: High
- Mana rate: Low

Looking like living mercury sculptures, silverstreams can be as hard and rigid as metal or as flexible and elusive as water. They have a consistent total mass and have difficulty adopting hollow shapes or non-humanoid body plans, but they‘re extremely flexible. Losing parts of their body is annoying but not crucial; they will reattach if they recover the stream-silver or slowly regrow it back up to their full normal mass. Silverstreams have little trouble maintaining a consistent shape, and can slowly change their default, but making it move like a human is trickier.

A drop of dead stream-silver in still water or on tarnishable metal will slowly convert it to stream-silver over the course of a week for a full body mass. Smaller amounts will need help transferring to new seed matter.

__Silverstreams draw Mana__ from Avoidance. Evading consequences for their actions or refusing to deal with something they need but do not want cause silverstreams to gain mana. This stacks. Dodging pain or injury give brief spikes of high gain.

### Perk
- Cost: 4

Silverstream transmuters can convert metal and water to stream-silver even while alive, and may use this as a catalyst or ingredient in Runes and Alchemy to reduce costs and, if pairing both magics, enhance effects.


## Race: Revenant
- Elements: Body, Necro
- Mana capacity: Medium
- Mana rate: High

Revenants are not alive, though they look very much like humans with slightly pallid coloring; they have no internal organs, their forms never change, and they repair damage rapidly if it does not destroy them, restoring their full form. They reproduce only by guarding intimate partners (or others with a strong physical connection) through their own deaths.

Revenants are very difficult to kill. If they are and their body is laid in the grave with someone who died cursing death, they will revive after about a tenth of the time since the deceased died.

__Revenants draw Mana__ from Endurance. Revenants gain main by subjecting themselves to things they dislike and remaining in their presence without acting to stop them. Taking up annoying fiddly hobbies or exercising to the point of pain are popular methods.


## Race: Petrichor
- Elements: Earth, Blood
- Mana capacity: Medium
- Mana rate: High

Petrichor lineages are born from places where gods bled. Their forms resemble clay statues of the wounded god, and missing limbs are particularly common. They all have weak connections to their divine ‘ancestor‘ and senses for things pertaining to their domains. Treating ordinary clay with sapient‘s blood allows them to repair the damage to their forms, but this breaks their divine connection, immortality, and charge if taken too far.

A destroyed Petrichor reforms slowly from their ancestral creation point, over the course of a year. Clay gardens tended by the lineage can serve as a replacement location, at most one per world.

__Petrichors draw Mana__ from Maiming. Impairment from missing limbs or similar durable injuries gives a Petrichor charge. Any prothesis (like a peg leg) reduces it, and a full-replacement one like the artifact drops it to a trickle.

### Perk
- Cost: 6

Some Petrichor draw the attention of their ancestral god, who gives them tasks like a Warlock patron (or a second patron), and rewards them with soul-bound artifacts rather than direct magical power.


## Perk: Skimmer Dancing
- Element: Water
- Class: Sorceress
- Cost: 3

You can walk and run across the surface of water or other liquids as if they were solid, even if it's very choppy. You can run up a waterfall, though it will be a little slow. This even extends to lava and similar, though it doesn't protect you from the heat or other dangers.
