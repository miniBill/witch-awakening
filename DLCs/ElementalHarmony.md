In a desert, Phlegethontes look entirely human. In humid places, though, their skin steams softly, and in the cold, their flesh gradually goes clear, showing their veins, which seem to flow with liquid fire, and their eye sockets, which have roaring candle flames behind the eyeballs. Cutting them releases the burning blood. They have a sixth sense for other people around them, the heat of their breath and beating of their blood standing out to a Phlegethon like a spotlight, though they canâ€™t distinguish individuals well.

On death, the flames from their blood spread explosively, and cannot be quenched without magic. If the flames take a life, or an intact heart is fed into them, the Phlegethon will reconstitute themself.

__Phlegethontes draw Mana__ from Crowds. Phlegethontes charge when in the presence of many people. They can gain a trickle from as few as two others, but only reach their full rate when a half-dozen people are nearby. If there are two dozen mortals or a hundred witches or other magical people within a hundred foot radius, they charge at a High rate.

### Perk
- Cost: 4

Some Phlegethons learn to deliberately release a layer of their blood and keep it under control, acting as a sheath of boiling-hot mist which explodes into flames whenever it is struck. This doesn't impede their senses or injure them.

## Perk: Skimmer Dancing
- Element: Water
- Class: Sorceress
- Cost: 3

You can walk and run across the surface of water or other liquids as if they were solid, even if it's very choppy. You can run up a waterfall, though it will be a little slow. This even extends to lava and similar, though it doesn't protect you from the heat or other dangers.
