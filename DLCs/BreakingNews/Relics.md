## Relic: Chronal Scanner
- Class: Academic
- Cost: 12

These coveted devices are the closet thing in Witchdom to a time machine. It works by scanning the area in a 5-mile radius and skimming back along the timeline to create a Domain bubble housing an interactive illusion of the area at some point in the past. The illusion isn't real, but IS accurate, you can't bring anything out but you could take a book off the shelf of a long-lost library and read its actual contents. Diverging too far from the “canon” course of events can introduce inaccuracies, however, especially if you use magic to do so. A Rank 5 mana infusion would let you go back up to a week but there is theoretically no limit to how far back it could scan given enough mana.

## Relic: Binding Tablets
- Class: Warlock
- Cost: 4

These clay tablets are enchanted with a contract of Rulership, allowing one signer to qualify as a follower of the other, with some caveats. First, the contract only applies when the follower is in the ruler's “service”, either directly sworn to serve them or working under them toward a common goal. For example, if you signed a contract with an employee it would only be active when they were on the clock, and stop working entirely if they quit. Second, the asymmetric nature of the magic means that the ruler must be at least one magic rank higher than the follower. Each purchase of this relic gives you 3 tablets, with Covenants Rank 3+ you can enchant more.

## Relic: Remote Doll
- Class: Warlock
- Costs: 6-8-26

This relic consists of two parts: a finely-crafted doll body, and a tiara linked to it. By wearing the tiara, you can remotely control the doll and access its senses, while it boosts your cognitive capacity to let you smoothly control your own body at the same time without any confusion. Unlike doll witches who might inherently have this ability, your remote body doesn't count as “you”, so it can't generate mana or serve as a backup if something happens to your real body. You can still cast spells using it, it's just drawn from your own mana pool. You can customize what your remote doll looks like, and purchase additional bodies linked to the same tiara (with identical or different appearances) for {2} per extra body.

## Relic: A Favor Owed
- Class: Warlock
- Cost: 4

You've helped a mid-high ranking member of one of the witch factions out of a tight spot, and honor or pragmatism demands they return the favor. They won't do anything that would jeopardize their standing with their faction, but you could call in this favor for one-time access to resources, archives, or backup that a typical faction member would have access to, or other string-pulling on that level. Buying this a second time for the same faction lets you forge a longer-term connection with that faction, becoming a trusted outsider and letting you take their faction magic at normal price (no faction discount, but not double-cost), as well as making dealing and collaborating with that faction much smoother.

## Relic: Reaper's Scythe
- Class: Sorceress
- Cost: 12

This scythe's blade is unnaturally cold to the touch and seems to drink in the light around it. An opponent hit by this weapon is slowed down by 5%, stacking multiplicatively. By infusing a strike with Rank 3 mana, you can strike with 3x speed, and the scythe will subtly guide itself toward vital areas. With R5 mana, you can become ethereal for 5 minutes, the scythe remains physical but you retain the ability to hold it. If you have ranks in Vampirism, killing a creature with this empowers you as though you had drained that creature to death, instantly and regardless of warding runes.

## Relic: Study Hall
- Class: Academic
- Cost: 15

This unassuming building has an powerful greater anima of learning bonded to it, reshaping its interior to create an ideal environment for learning magic. If you are an Academic, the inside will manifest as a library filled with books on magical theory, if you are a Sorceress it instead resembles a gym and arena for hands-on magic training. In addition to a number of automated features and small magical conveniences, studying or training here causes you to gain Focus or Might 5x faster, up to a maximum of 10 per day. Any mundane skills that are learned or practiced here also improve much faster, as though the student had a talent rune.
