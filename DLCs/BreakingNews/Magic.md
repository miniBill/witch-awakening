## Magic: Animism
- Class: Warlock
- Elements: Water, Fire, Earth, Wind
- Faction: The Lydian Sisterhood

The ancient art of binding nature spirits, commonly called anima to distinguish them from other spirit beings. Anima are manifestations of the fundamental forces of reality, personifying an element of nature in both its physical and more abstract associations. Anima are grouped into 4 aspects: ignan anima embody fire, destruction, energy, and growth, terran anima embody earth, stasis, physical matter, and protection, aquan anima embody water, change, life, and connection, and auran anima embody air, creation, the mind, and freedom. Before an anima will agree to be bound, it requires services equivalent to a folk quest, usually not risky but taking at least a few hours, themed according to their aspect. An aquan anima might have you cleaning up a river, or an auran might have you helping someone get past writer's block.

_*Rank 0*_: Anima spend most of their time “asleep”, in a diffuse state of consciousness over a wide area. Most witches have instinctive knowledge of when a sleeping anima is nearby, and of a three minute song (sung or played on any instrument) to awaken them. They can't do much while unbound, but can report on events in their area or perform very minor magic effects akin to lighting candles. No service needed at this level, as you aren't binding them.

### Rank 1
With an hour-long ritual, you can bind an anima to any inanimate object. The effects depend greatly on the object used, but generally ignan anima increase an object's power output or make it more conductive, terran heavier or more durable, auran lighter or more flexible, aquan sharper or more precise. Amounts to roughly a 20% boost. Once bound, anima are usually satisfied to go back to sleep within the object, so the binding can be considered indefinite as long as that object sees semi-regular use and isn't just sitting in a vault somewhere.

### Rank 2
With Rank 2 your objects have a 50% boost, and you can bind anima to a location, which doesn't have to be the location you found them. This provides a passive influence on the area, subtly pushing events into alignment with the anima's associated concepts. For example, binding an terran anima to a building would have a solidifying effect on the building and everything inside, and within the boundaries attempts at protection or maintenance would be strengthened and significant changes would be less likely to occur. The effect is subtle for now, but gets stronger with each rank in animism.

### Rank 3
You can bind anima to living beings, more to their souls than their physical bodies. This influences the being's fate in a generally positive direction, though the manifestation naturally depends on the anima used. Terran anima protect against misfortune and guide your fate towards safety and comfort. Ignan anima put risks and challenges in your path, leading to ample opportunities for growth. Auran anima favor adventure and novelty, dropping exciting opportunities in your lap that rarely have any lasting impact. Aquan anima respond to your own efforts, improving your chance of success at any endeavor without affecting external events that might happen to you. Your other bindings now boost characteristics by 100%.

### Rank 4
You can now bind anima to a specially-prepared doll body, requiring time and materials like an R4 rune to create. Bound anima can control this doll as though it were their own body, and can use magic equivalent to R3 of its associated elementalism. There is no hard limit to the number of bound dolls you can have, but anima bound in this way will expect greater and ongoing services if you want them to remain awake and to follow you. Equivalent to a heroic quest at the time of first binding, and an additional folk-tier quest for each month of service. Each individual anima you have requires its own services, effectively limiting the number you can control at once. Your physical bindings now boost by 200%.

### Rank 5
Masters of animism have the ability to awaken and bind greater anima. Rather than a broad connection to everything encompassed by their aspect, greater anima have a much stronger and narrower focus. This can be physical and/or conceptual, for example a greater aquan anima of swans (a subset of life) could influence both the physical animals and associated traits like grace and beauty. Greater anima are more powerful than their lesser kin, with abilities corresponding to R4 esoteric elementalism when bound to doll bodies and other binding effects roughly twice as strong as normal. However, they are also prouder, requiring services one quest tier higher in exchange for their binding. Your physical bindings now boost by 500%.


## Magic: Metamagic
- Elements: All
- Class: Academic
- Faction: The Lydian Sisterhood

Metamagic is a broad field encompassing various means of shaping the effects of other magic specializations, or raw mana itself. Naturally, most of what a witch can do with it depends on the other types of magic they have access to, but generally speaking it's used to create more complex or precise effects than would be possible with the other specialization on its own. Nowadays it's most famous for the elaborate technomagic creations that can be woven using high-level metamagic, with the Seekers' Guild's realmships being one example.

### Rank 1
Gain access to the metamagic ability Stealth Cast. When casting a spell up to your rank of metamagic, you can pay double the mana cost to remove the need to speak or gesture (though casting time is unchanged), and  suppress any obvious visual indicators of casting magic that aren't part of the magic effect itself. You also gain the ability to Dial Down your spells when casting, reducing the intensity, duration, etc. to anywhere below the maximum levels given in the spell description. Cast a fireball with the pushback effect but no spreading flames, a curse that wears off after a few minutes, etc.

### Rank 2
With Rank 2 you can Imbue Mana into any object by touching the object and meditating, and draw it back out with just a bit of focus. These Mana Lodes as they're commonly known can be filled or emptied at roughly the same speed as a low charge rate, but the speed stacks if you're drawing from multiple lodes. The maximum mana an object can hold depends on its value, monetary, historical, or sentimental, with crystals having a structure particularly favorable to storing mana. A rock picked up off the ground could hold enough mana for an R1 spell or two, a fist-sized diamond could hold enough to fill a High mana capacity a dozen times over.

### Rank 3
Your Dial Down ability is now a proper Rebalance, by weakening some aspects of a spell you can boost others. Turn a fireball into a much hotter touch-range attack, cast a weaker curse that lasts longer, etc. The largest boost this can give is 150% intensity or double the range or duration. You can also Toggle your ongoing magical effects, turning the effects on and off at will until the end of the usual spell duration. Note that time toggled off still counts toward the spell's duration, so turning it off doesn't make it last longer.

### Rank 4
You can now Imbue entire spells into objects, wands and scrolls are popular but any object can be used. Imbuing a spell requires double the costs (in mana, materials, etc.) as casting it normally, as well as a ritual of 10 minutes per rank on top of any casting time for the base spell, and infuses the object with one “charge” of that spell. If you pay the costs multiple times over you can Imbue multiple spell charges with only 1 minute of additional ritual time per charge. Most objects have a capacity of around 10 charges, again depending on value, and a single object can only hold charges for one type of spell at once. Anybody holding the object can cast the Imbued spell by expending a charge and paying the mana cost, whether or not they have access to that spell normally. Or if attached to a Mana Lode as a power source, it can even be cast by non-witches. Also, with time and materials like an R3 rune you can now create a Mana Siphon about the size of a toaster that can fill a Mana Lode or power an Imbued object, passively drawing mana from the environment at one third the speed of a low charge rate. If you have a charge method that makes sense for an inanimate object, you can attune a Siphon to this method instead.

### Rank 5
The pinnacle of Metamagic, you can now Imbue multiple types of spells in a single object, and your Imbued spells are now fully programmable. Traditionally done with elaborate magic circles defining the logic, many modern witches opt for inscribed computers instead. You still require mana and are limited to a set number of imbued spell charges, but you can get around this by using Runes or Wands-based permanent effects, which can then be toggled as desired. Similarly, magics like Curses, Covenants or Psychotics can be used for contingency-based effects beyond what your system could normally detect. If using a computer you can also incorporate mundane functions, such as locking someone out of your systems if a Divination contingency foresees a betrayal. Creating programmed objects requires a large up-front investment to imbue the magic, but there is essentially no limit to how complex they can be. Additionally, your toggled spell effects no longer count toward their duration while turned off.


## Magic: Rulership
- Elements: Body, Mind, Beast
- Class: Warlock

Rulership centers around your bond with followers, a broad category that includes any being you have summoned, created, bound, or magically controlled by any means, including but not limited to such magics as Monstrosity, Consortation, Necromancy, Naturalism, Animism, Hex Golems, or even a Witch Deck. Also, your own familiar, if you have one, always counts as a follower. Do note that making something a follower does not make it any more loyal to you than it otherwise would be, though they may be inclined to stay on your good side to keep the power-boost you can provide them. Still, if you want total obedience you may need to supplement this magic with other methods.

### Rank 1
With Rank 1, you can have a single follower that meets the above criteria. You can change who your current follower is with a 1-minute ritual, as long as the new follower is willing and in your presence. Either of you can break the connection instantly, if you choose. You have a vague awareness of your follower's current location and state, enough to know if they're in danger or if they've accomplished a task you gave them, but not specific details. Additionally, your follower's physical characteristics are slightly strengthened, by about 10%.

### Rank 2
You can have up to 3 followers, and they are boosted by 15%, now including mental attributes and skills. Your connection to them is now a full telepathic link, allowing either of you to project your thoughts to the other. You can also use the connection to “ride along” with a follower, replacing your senses with their own, if you want to keep a closer eye on what they're doing.

### Rank 3
12 followers, boosted by 25%, now including magical or otherwise supernatural traits. Additionally, you may have a single grand follower (doesn't count against your normal follower limit), who instead gets a 100% boost. You can now, if you choose, tighten your psychic link with your followers to passively share your desires and intentions. This allows you to perfectly coordinate your actions with your followers, and for them to anticipate and act on your wishes without needing to be directly ordered. You can also have perfect awareness of your followers' current state, but this can become disorienting to maintain for several followers at once, so it's best used for quick “check-ins”.

### Rank 4
Up to 64 followers with a 50% boost, and up to 3 grand followers with a 200% boost. Your link with your followers is now a network, with the followers linked to each other instead of just to you. This allows them to work perfectly together and makes giving orders and maintaining awareness of your followers easier since you don't need to interface with each one separately. If your followers are sapient, they can use this for an effective intelligence boost by maintaining multiple trains of thought and pooling their mental resources. You can even tap into this through your connection, though the limit is closer to “genius human” than “incomprehensible superintelligence.” You can also, with permission, take direct control of a follower. You can't cast spells while possessing a follower, but you can use any of their physical abilities.

### Rank 5
Masters of Rulership may have an unlimited number of normal followers with a 100% boost, and up to 12 grand followers with a 300% boost. You may now infuse your bond to your followers with a small portion of your own magic, granting your followers the ability to use one magic specialization that you possess, up to Rank 3. Not affected by their ability boost, since it's your magic, not theirs. Grand followers can instead have up to Rank 5, provided you yourself have Rank 5 in that magic, and you can give each grand follower a different specialization whereas you are limited to one R3 magic at a time for all your normal followers. You can change your shared specializations, but doing so takes 24 hours, during which time the follower doesn't have access to either the old or new magic. Also, you can now use your own magical abilities while possessing a follower, and if they are a grand follower, you can use their magical abilities too.


## Magic: Vampirism
- Elements: Necro, Blood + Body
- Elementalism: True
- Class: Sorceress

Despite the name, this isn't related to vampires or blood magic. It actually deals with manipulation of necrotic energy, a hollow, hungry force that leeches the life out of whatever it comes into contact with. I should warn you that this specialization tends to attract more power-hungry witches, which has given it a bad reputation in magic circles. It CAN be used for good, don't get me wrong, but you can expect to be a bit mistrusted by default by people who know you have this magic.

Each rank of Vampirism magic gives you a 50% resistance to energy, strength, and mana draining effects, including mundane fatigue. At rank 3, you no longer need sleep and could maintain a walking pace indefinitely, but your resistance to strenuous activity and magical effects continues to be reduced by 50% per level.

### Rank 1
You can surround yourself with an aura of necrotic energy, visible as a distortion of the air around you. This aura can sap the life energy of one person or animal within 20 feet of you, making them gradually weaker and more sluggish over time, or from all plants and insects in the same radius, causing them to wither and eventually die. Unless stated otherwise, your drain effects are considered direct magic damage and blocked by warding runes. Drained energy can be used to invigorate yourself; draining the life from a meadow or making a small animal too weak to move would take a few minutes and refresh you like a few hours of restful sleep.

### Rank 2
Your aura is now powerful enough to kill animals, or you can hold back to just render them comatose. Coma lasts a few hours, with no long-term harm to them. You can drain a meadow in one minute, x5 for large plants or small animals from mouse to cat-sized, x10 for animals up to a mundane human in size, x20 for larger or magical creatures, including witches. This multiplier applies to both the time taken to drain them and the total amount of energy gained from draining to death or coma. Those unable to die such as the immortality-cursed have a functionally infinite supply of life energy, though limited by your drain rate, while liches have none unless you were able to drain from their phylactery instead of their body. You can use energy you absorb to heal yourself, up to a papercut per second, with a meadow providing about 30 seconds worth of healing. You can store drained energy for later, though it dissipates at a rate of 10% of your current total per hour, vanishing entirely 24 hours after you last gained energy.

### Rank 3
Drain a meadow in 30 seconds, with double the range, and your aura can now affect multiple animals within this range. Draining multiple animals at once can stack the benefits, for faster healing for example. With direct skin-to-skin (or equivalent) contact, you can drain life 10x as fast. You can make your aura invisible to those who can't see spirits, mortals will still feel weakened with extended drain but may not know the cause. You can now convert your drained energy into mana as an alternate mana source. A meadow would fill 10% of a low mana capacity.

### Rank 4
Drain a meadow in 15 seconds, doubling the range again. Your drained energy can now empower you physically, a meadow could give you a boost of 5 percentage-seconds to any one physical attribute. So a 1% boost for 5 seconds, or a 5% boost for 1 second, or anywhere in between. Most use it in bursts to empower a specific blow for example. Caps at a maximum of x10 at a time, though you'd have to kill/K.O. many creatures to actually hit that cap. Also, if you kill an intelligent creature or render them comatose with your draining, you can absorb one of their mundane skills. Your skill level raises to match theirs, permanently, while theirs lowers to what yours was, though they can always train it back up. You can give your drained energy to others within your auras range, albeit inefficiently, benefitting them about 1/3 as much as it would benefit yourself.

### Rank 5
Drain a meadow in 5 seconds. Your energy storage is more efficient, only losing 5% per hour, and your physical boosts cap at x20. Your skin-contact draining can now bypass warding runes, or you can channel your aura into a melee attack to apply a half-second of drain if the attack lands. If you kill a witch or render them comatose with your drain, you can absorb one of their magic specializations. There's no time limit on this, but you can only hold on to one specialization at a time, absorbing another releases the previous one. They lose access to the drained specialization until you release it. By meditating in a fixed location, you can expand your aura beyond its normal limits, doubling in range every 5 minutes until capping out at city scale.
