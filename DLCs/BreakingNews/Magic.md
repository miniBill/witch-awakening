## Magic: Animism
- Class: Warlock
- Elements: Water, Fire, Earth, Wind
- Faction: The Lydian Sisterhood

The ancient art of binding nature spirits, commonly called anima to distinguish them from other spirit beings. Anima are manifestations of the fundamental forces of reality, personifying an element of nature in both its physical and more abstract associations. Anima are grouped into 4 aspects: ignan anima embody fire destruction, energy, and growth, terran anima embody earth, stasis, physical matter, and protection, aquan anima embody water, change, life, and connection, and auran anima embody air, creation, the mnd, and freedom. Before an anima will agree to be bound, it requires services equivalent to a folk quest, usually not risky but taking at least a few hours, themed according to their aspect. An aquan anima might have you cleaning up a river, or an auran might have you helping someone get past writer's block.

_*Rank 0*_: Anima spend most of their time “asleep”, in a diffuse state of consciousness over a wide area. Most witches have instinctive knowledge of when a sleeping anima is nearby, and of a three minute song (sung or played on any instrument) to awaken them. They can't do much while unbound, but can report on events in their area or perform very minor magic effects akin to lighting candles. No service needed at this level, as you aren't binding them.

### Rank 1
With an hour-long ritual, you can bond an anima to any inanimate object. The effects depend greatly on the object used, but generally ignan anima increase an object's power output or make it mote conductive, terran heavier or more durable, auran lighter or more flexible, aquan sharper or more precise. Amounts to roughly a 20% boost. Once bound, anima are usually satisfied to go back to sleep within the object, so the binding can be considered indefinite as long as that object sees semi-regular use and isn't just sitting in a vault somewhere.

### Rank 2
With Rank 2 your objects have a 50% boost, and you can bind anima to a location, which doesn't have to be the location you found them. This provides a passive influence on the area, subtly pushing events into alignment with the anima's associated concepts. For example, binding an terran anima to a building would have a solidifying effect on the building and everything inside, and within the boundaries attempts at protection or maintenance would be strengthened and significant changes would be less they to occur. The effect is subtle for now, but gets stronger with each rank in Animism.

### Rank 3
You can bind anima to living beings, more to their souls than their physical bodies. This influences the being's fate in a generally positive direction, though the manifestation naturally depends on the anima used. Terran anima protect against misfortune and guide your fate towards safety and comfort. Ignan anima put risks and challenges in your path, leading to ample opportunities for growth. Auran anima favor adventure and novelty, dropping exciting opportunities in your lap that rarely have any lasting impact. Aquan anima respond to your own efforts, improving your chance of success at any endeavor without affecting external events that might happen to you. Your other bindings now boost characteristics by 100%.

### Rank 4
You can now bind anima to a specially-prepared doll body, requiring time and materials like an R4 rune to create. Bound anima can control this doll as though it were their own body, and can use magic equivalent to R3 of its associated elementalism. There is no hard limit to the number of bound dolls you can have, but anima bound in this way will expect greater and ongoing services if you want them to remain awake and to follow you. Equivalent to a heroic quest at the tine of first binding, and an additional folk-tier quest for each month of service. Each individual anima you have requires its own services, effectively limiting the number you can control at once. Your physical bindings now boost by 200%.

### Rank 5
Masters of animism have the ability to awaken and bind greater anima. Rather than a broad connection to everything encompassed by their aspect, greater anima have a much stronger and narrower focus. This can be physical and/or conceptual, for example a greater aquan anima of swans (a subset of life) could influence both the physical animals and associated traits like grace and beauty. Greater anew are more powerful than their lesser kin, with abilities corresponding to R4 esoteric elementalism when bound to doll bodies and other binding effects roughly twice as strong as normal. However, they are also prouder, requiring services one quest tier higher in exchange for their binding. Your physical bindings now boost by 500%.
