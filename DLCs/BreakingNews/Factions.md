## Faction: The Lydian Sisterhood
- Short name: Lydian
- Collective name: The Lydians
- Motto: Shamans Without Borders

A truly ancient faction, the earliest predecessors of the Sisterhood (a gender-neutral term covering an members) date back to some of the first known witches on Earth. The stories of wise women living alone in the woods. communing with nature and helping passersby with a potion or augury, are often based on Lydians. But our goals have always been much bigger than just telling farmers when to sow. Humans share the Earth with a vast array of supernatural entities, in both the physical and spirit planes, and we act as intermediaries between these worlds. Forging pacts and mediating disputes between Earth's denizens and... other interested parties, and ensuring that humanity has a safe place in the balance of power. While we aren't pacifists, we would much rather make friends than enemies, and most view diplomacy as the first resort and violence as a distant second.

Where we differ from most other factions, and the reason some don't consider us a faction at all, is that we don't have hierarchies or a central authority. Since no one is in charge, every Lydian has the freedom to negotiate their own terms without being bound by existing agreements another Lydian may have made. We have no restrictions on joining and no formal list of members, but we are unified by our shared priorities of negotiation, collaboration, and protecting mundane humans. Witches who don't uphold these values are effectively blacklisted from the Sisterhood until they change their approach, as Lydians won't want to work with them. The unstructured nature of the sisterhood doesn't mean you'd be on your own however. There's no strict requirements or top-down orders, but we have a cultural expectation to help each other out when is not too inconvenient. We all pitch in where we can, and that means we all have a network to fall back on when we have problems too big to handle alone, or just out of our wheelhouse. Some groups of sisters establish more permanent volunteer organizations geared towards a specific goal, the Lydian News Network being one example. The Sisterhood also tends to attract sociable sorts in general, so you can expect to be invited to lots of gatherings if you make even a slight effort to make friends.

We typically stay away from celestials and demons, leaving them to the Watchers and Hespatia respectively, and instead deal heavily with the multitude of gods and Spirits of the world. The difference between the two groups is more one of scale than kind, for the record. While any witch can work for a divine patron and gain personal boons, Lydians care more about maintaining a good relationship between spirits and humans, for a longer-term payoff for all parties. Most sisters work with small local gods, but as one of the more powerful witches out there you could move In the “big leagues” with the kind of gods most people have heard of, if you want to. If you join up with us, you'd naturally have a lot of freedom for how you want to pursue our goals. Make friends with mundane humans, or nature spirits, or the vampire bloodlines running cities from the shadows. Lead peace talks between dryads and werewolves. Sneak your sick neighbor a potion for a “surprisingly speedy recovery.” Make one-off deals with gods, or form a longer-term pact as a divine intermediary. Provide magical backup for your less powerful sisters' own quests. The sky's the limit, and don't forget we'll have your back.

### Location
Having no central authority, the Sisterhood also lacks anything like a central headquarters. Most of us pick a place to put down roots and build relationships with the local spirits and supernatural denizens, often helping out the mortals in the area while we're at it. Most places on Earth have some amount of supernatural presence, some magical beings have their own hidden societies, while others are solitary creatures. Many prefer to live away from humans, especially larger beasts and those the veil doesn't hide as well. As a result. most Lydians choose to settle down in rural areas, but there are city-based sisters as well. Communal places mostly exist, at the local level, with many pocketspaces or domain bubbles acting as a meeting space for Lydians based out of a given region. Long-distance connections are maintained through sending networks, distributing requests or news on a regional or global level. If you become known as a specialist for a certain type of magic or dealing with a certain kind of entity, you may become the go-to person for handling crises in that field.

### Relations
Our faction relations depend greatly on the individual sister, but we generally pride ourselves on our diplomacy. Though, we are known to have some friction with the Watchers and Hespatians, as we believe in letting humans make their own choices instead of actively shaping society. Regardless, sisters will still often work with both factions to our mutual benefit.

### Perk: Serpent's Tongue
A leftover from a long ago divine pact, you've been blessed with a Diplomat's gifts. You learn languages unnaturally fast (you could go from zero to fluent in a week), and can detect lies, decried as intentional, literal falsehoods. When you speak the truth yourself, others will usually believe you. Not necessarily agree with you, and paranoid enough people may be unaffected, but most will trust that you're not lying to them. Has the side effect of making your voice very pleasant to listen to.
