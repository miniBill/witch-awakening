## Quest: Royal Reincarnation
- Slot: Noble
- Threat: 4
- Conflict: 7
- Reward: 3

Some fluke of the world's afterlife system causes your soul to be mistakenly flagged as deceased and sent to another Aetheric sphere entirely for reincarnation. The good news is the local deities are aware of your situation, the bad news is your new identity is a doomed princess destined to meet a terrible end, and the bonds of fate are keeping them from interfering. Play through either Otome Villainess Reincarnation [https://imgchest.com/p/md7olnad7p6], Royal Revival [https://imgchest.com/p/n87wr8vpxyx], or Scheming Princess [https://imgchest.com/p/vj4j3mv2y8m]. If you can push fate to it's breaking point and avert your Bad End, the gods can send you home, dropping you back into your old life with no time having passed.

Notes:
+ You retain some witch magic in this world but are limited to Rank 1
+ Upon your return, you can pay {4} per choice to keep anything gained in the other world, or {15} if it's a type of magic. Balanced relative to WA specializations.

### Sidebar
You can be a prince instead if you want, any Patriarchal elements become Matriarchal or vice versa in this case. Similarly, Otome Villainess' love interests can be genderswapped, and you can choose a same-gender betrothed in Royal Revival if you want.


## Quest: The Source of Magic
- Slot: Heroic
- Threat: 8
- Conflict: 2
- Reward: 5

Whispered tales speak of a place hidden deep within the realm sphere, where the first witch received her magic in ages past. Many pilgrims have sought this place, but none have found it in living memory, which, for witches, is a very long time. Seeking the Source is a spiritual journey as well as a physical one, taking you through strange realms from the serene to the perilous, and forcing you to confront your inner flaws and fears to progress. Actually beholding it is a transcendently beautiful experience that leaves you with a lasting sense of inner peace and purpose - and a permanently shifted relationship to your own magic.

Notes:
+ Finding the Source lets you take ONE option from here (or the base CYOA, or other DLC), that you don't qualify for A bonus elementalism as a non-Sorceress, a type perk for a witch race you aren't, an option normally locked behind a certain magic rank or  a quest, and so on.

### Sidebar
You can only take a single option this way, and you do still have to pay the normal costs for it. Costless options, like extra quests or faction perks, aren't allowed.


## Quest: Golden Child
- Slot: Noble
- Threat: 5
- Conflict: 5
- Reward: 4
- Faction: The Lydian Sisterhood

Luxal nobility are known for their cutthroat politics, family rivalries are both labyrinthine and vicious. The Vesten are a bloodline particularly friendly to the Lydian sisterhood, who have recently had their territories usurped and been driven into hiding by their nemeses. As a capable Sister or ally, you have been entrusted with the youngest child of the family, Karis Vesten. Keep her safe and happy until her family's allies are able to restore them to power (around 2 years unless you intervene to speed things up), and you'll have some new friends in high places.

Notes:
+ Will have to deal with agents of the rival family, unless you can hide Karis from them.
+ For a villainous route, maybe you've kidnapped Karis yourself, to secure a ransom in kisses or favors


## Quest: Apple of Discord
- Slot: Epic
- Threat: 8
- Conflict: 10
- Reward: 6
- Faction: The Lydian Sisterhood

The Clarae are a triumvirate of deities of strength, wisdom, and beauty, each strongly influential on Earth with a delicate balance of power between them. Recently, devotees of each god have gone missing, and the already tense relationship between the three gods threatens to boil over into outright war. The Lydians have been chosen to run a neutral investigation, and with some evidence seeming to point to each deity, a lot of tact will be needed to find answers without setting off this diplomatic powder keg.

Notes:
+ The culprit is a minor trickster god out to prove cunning to be the greatest virtue, if confronted he will offer the worshippers' return and a bribe worth an extra 4RP in exchange for your silence.
+ Alternatively, you can turn him in to the Clarae, who will offer a spark of excellence as a reward, anything skill-based you attempt will result in the best performance you could reasonably achieve with your current skill level.


## Quest: Shore Leave
- Slot: Folk
- Threat: 1
- Conflict: 2
- Reward: 2
- Faction: The Seekers' Guild

When your assigned vessel (or a ship you're close to if not a Seeker) is docked for some routine maintenance, the crew gets a week or so off to explore, bond with crewmates, or just enjoy some R&R. You might be docked in any plane in the Union of Realms, many of which have heavily divergent nature and culture from Earth. Feel free to customize within the general scope of realm types defined in base WA. Hike through strange landscapes, sample the cuisine, or find a local festival to take part in. Or just relax on the beach beneath an alien sky. Maybe take a souvenir or two back with you too.

Notes:
+ How will you spend your time? Your companions and crewmates might have their own ideas
+ Potential for cultural misunderstandings, though you'd be given some grace as a foreigner


## Quest: Pandora's Box
- Slot: Epic
- Threat: 9
- Conflict: 8
- Reward: 7
- Faction: The Seekers' Guild

The Pandora swarm is a technomagical experiment escaped from captivity long ago, a nanobot hive capable of mimicking the form, mind, and magic of anything it consumes. It's spent the last few thousand years growing, learning, and infiltrating societies, and concluded that organics could be happier if it was in charge. It's now attempting a shadowy takeover of the universe one realm at a time, and its distributed nature makes it all but impossible to stop directly. The Seekers' Guild has learned of a remote kill switch hidden away in the original lab where the swarm was “born.” Uncover the lab's location and activate the switch, before the swarm finds out anyone is onto it.

Notes:
+ The swarm has rank 5 in nearly every magic specialization, and is very good at adapting to known threats
+ It could be anyone, be careful who you trust

### Sidebar
Alternatively, the lab has a “factory reset” option as well as the kill switch. Taking this route unlocks the reset swarm as a potential companion (see below)
