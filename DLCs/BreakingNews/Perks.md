## Perk: Barrier Witch
- Element: All
- Class: Academic
- Cost: 6

You have a natural talent for defensive magics. You can create barriers of magical energy the same color as your aura, either a 4 by 4 ft square shield or a 7 ft radius bubble. The bubble resists physical damage like 2 inch thick steel, the shield resists it like the same thickness of mithril. Either can be summoned as fast as you can react, but have a very fast mana drain, they're best used in bursts. With time and materials like a R4 rune, you can create a totem to ward an area up to a 1 mile radius, preventing magical beings from entering without permission or directly affecting the inside with magic (including scrying or portal travel). The effect ends if the totem is destroyed or removed from the original location.

## Perk: Kinesis
- Element: All
- Class: Academic
- Cost: 4

A simple but versatile form of telekinesis, you can move objects within 60ft of you with as much force and precision as if you were moving them with your hands. You can move multiple objects at once, but doing so requires concentration, just holding things in the air is easy while complex movements require a lot of focus. You can also shoot “magic missiles” of raw kinetic force, which move with the speed of an arrow, hit with the force of a punch, and have a very low mana cost. Often used as a spam attack, or by witches without other combat magic.

## Perk: Telepathic
- Element: Mind
- Class: Academic
- Cost: 6

Your mind is naturally attuned to psychic frequencies. With a few seconds of concentration, you can read the surface thoughts of a single unwarded target that you are looking at. Breaking your focus or line of sight also breaks the connection. However, strong emotions as well as thoughts that are specifically about or directed at you can be automatically read within 30ft, even if you weren't previously aware of that person, though still blocked by warding runes. If you also have Sending (Div rank 0), you can combine it with this ability for two-way mental conversations with targets in your range, including general ideas and impressions as well as verbalized thoughts.

## Perk: Dealmaker
- Element: Soul
- Class: Warlock
- Requires: Covenants 1+
- Cost: 12

A specialized type of Covenant magic originally pioneered by demons, you have the ability to trade in intangible aspects of a person's being. With the right clause of a contract, you can buy and sell skills, memories, or relationships. You can even trade in souls, you don't get the actual soul until the seller dies, but the contracts of ownership are highly valued by certain entities. You can give anything you acquire to yourself, or keep it in reserve to trade later. This magic only works with direct contracts (not laws), and while you CAN buy focus, might, favor, or power from others you cannot exceed your power cap this way.

## Perk: Esoteric Element
- Element: All
- Class: Sorceress
- Cost: 15

Requires R1+ of any elementalism. Some witches have rare affinities beyond the classic elements. With this perk you can replace an elemental magic you possess with another “element” not covered by an existing specialization. This can be anything as concrete as Acid or Paper, to something as abstract as Luck or Time. You do lose the original elemental magic, and your control of the new element is of a similar power to equivalent-rank elementalism, with broader elements being generally weaker. Use your best judgement, for example a Bone element would be similar to Necromancy's bone control, while R5 Time magic would cap out at 10x acceleration or deceleration of targets or, with preparation, an area up to city size.

## Perk: Clean Slate
- Class: Warlock
- Cost: 0

Sometimes, the veil reacts oddly to newly awakened witches, and instead of rewriting records and memories to match their true form, it erases them entirely. As far as the mundane world is concerned, you never existed. The timeline isn't actually changed so don't worry about any butterfly effects, but those affected by the veil will be unable to acknowledge any inconsistencies even if pointed out to them. You could always reintroduce yourself to them, but you'll be starting over as a stranger. On the other hand, you can fully dive into magical society without maintaining a double life, and any loved ones won't miss you.
