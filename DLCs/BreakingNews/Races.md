Swarms are an artificial race first created long ago, sentient clouds of self-replicating nanobots. Their natural form is a mass of bots which they can reshape like a fluid, but they can interlock their structure to assume a secondary form that can visually resemble any other witch type. Extra assimilated mass can make their humanoid form larger or just denser, or can be controlled in swarm form as long as it's near their main body, otherwise inert. Modern swarms reproduce by budding off some of their mass into an independent child swarm, inheriting memories at the parent's discretion and resulting in a strange species culture of branching histories. Swarms don't age, and can regenerate from damage by consuming matter as long as a grain of rice's mass remains. Swarms have the the Meta pseudo-affinity, half-off on any option marked as “Meta”. Stacks with other applicable affinities, rounding up.

__Swarms draw Mana__ from Assimilation, breaking down material they come into contact with and converting it into more of themselves. By default, it would take 3 seconds to dissolve a fully-engulfed apple, proportionately slower for larger and more durable objects.

### Perk
- Cost: 10

More powerful swarms are able to learn the structure of what they assimilate, and to incorporate it into themselves. These swarms can replicate the physical form of anything they have consumed, allowing for shapeshifting or “summoning” tools. Note that most abilities like super-strength are partly magical in nature and can't be replicated this way, but things like replacing their bones with steel are very doable. If they assimilate a living being, they gain a copy of that being's memories, including both skills and emotional associations. These memories are in first-person and just as vivid as the swarm's own memories, which can complicate the swarm's sense of self. Though they don't truly merge with those assimilated, if someone gets absorbed, they're dead and their soul goes wherever it normally would. Swarms with this perk may also take Integration as if they had the faction discount, with no observer, and can apply nanomachine properties to their own body mass.
