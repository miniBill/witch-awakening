Beatrice has been living in the same small town for decades, right at a leyline nexus that draws all sorts of magical activity. By day, she's a pillar of the community, sitting on the town council, helping residents out, and sneaking them a bit of magical aid when she can get away with it. By night, she's a werebear, doing the same for magical denizens and fending off monstrous threats alongside her clan.

- Mixed: +/- Leans toward a mentorship role in most of her interactions
- Has: Sigrid has Covenants 1, Nature 4, Anima 5, Dealmaker, and Serpent's Tongue

Sigrid really lives up to the hermit image the Lydians sometimes have, living deep in the wilds with only spirits for company. She's the one behind the Serpent's Tongue pact, one of several divine bargains she's cemented as one of our top diplomats. Aescetic and contemplative, her idea of a perfect morning is waking up at 5 am to watch the sunrise in silence.

Hestia runs a pocketspace as a sort of sanctuary for anyone who requests it. She has covenant laws to prevent violence, but doesn't eject people except in extreme cases. Many come for protection from their enemies, or a neutral ground in mediating conflicts, but she also gets some visitors who just want to get away from it all for a while.

Their magic manifests as control over ink and paper, plus some more abstract abilities such as muselike inspiration.

Lysander is a divine emissary, a longtime agent of a god of death and fate. He works heavily with reapers, hunting down rogue spirits and those foreseen to threaten the larger fate of the Earth. Most of his targets are actively destructive, but he does sometimes have to hunt down innocent souls, whose life would lead to a butterfly effect that would threaten the weave of fate.

- Has: Sylvie has Divine 4, Witchery 4, Familiarity 5 (Hummingbird), Anima 5, Serpent's Tongue and Familiar's Company (Water Elemental, 20 points)

That's me, the one who recorded this message. My familiar Kiri and I are reporters for the Lydian News Network. We're firm believers in freedom of information. Regardless of our factions, all of witchdom is better off if we all know what's going on in the world! I spend most of my time in the field, tracking down leads or chasing reports to get to the scene of an event before it's too late.

- Mixed: +/- Constantly sharing thoughts through their bond, they're more like one witch in two bodies
- Has: Heather has Alch 3 and Psych 4, Sage has Nature 3 and Divine 4, and both have Telepathic and Keystone Shard
Heather (left) and Sage (right) come from a realm heavily influenced by Earth and Mind, a land of massive crystal caverns where even the nonwitches are natural telepaths. Their realm was only recently contacted by the Seekers' Guild, and they immediately signed up to experience the wider universe. Still getting used to interplanar social norms, like people being uncomfortable having their thoughts read.

- Negative: - Poor organization
- Mixed: +/- Likes to loan new tech to her friends so they can be her guinea pigs
- Has: Fira has Metamagic 5, Wands 5, Hexes 5, Divine 5, and Keeper Alch and Omnimancy
One of the Guild's foremost engineers, Fira's inventions have a reputation for being both very potent, and prone to malfunction in bizarre ways. At this point, her ship's crew getting shrunk to an inch tall or stuck in a time loop is just another Thursday to them. Fira, for her part, insists that it's all part of the joy of discovery.

Vivian harkens back to the old days of the guild, an intrepid explorer charting realms in her own private craft. She has a strong love of freedom and discovery, always seeking strange new places and never letting herself get tied down anywhere. While friendly and outgoing, she keeps most at arms length, and has yet to take on any crew despite her ship having the space.

- Negative: - Very hesitant to use violent solutions
- Mixed: +/- Never makes decisions lightly, always considering the impact on everyone
- Has: Elara has Metamagic 3, Covenants 3, Anima 4, Runes 4, Rulership 5, and Binding Tablets
Once a reknowned negotiator for the Sisterhood, Elara is now the captain of one of the Guild's flagship vessels. An expert of rulership, she makes contracts with her crew to boost their abilities. She has the same spark of wonder and curiosity that drive so many Seekers, but tempered with caution and the weight of responsibility for thousands of souls. Old friend of Sigrid's.

Leon is security for planetside missions, making sure his mortal crewmates can do their job safely. While he's no pushover, he prefers to avoid fights, scouting ahead or using divination to ensure the crew don't get into danger in the first place. Has a watchful and caring “big brother” personality, always trying to keep his team happy as well as safe.

Lysander's sister, though the two are somewhat estranged over Thalia's choice to leave the Sisterhood for the Guild. She's a scientist specializing in planar metaphysics, how realms develop and how exposure to elemental and divine energy shapes their properties. Has a fascination and drive to understand the fundamental nature of the universe that borders on the obsessive.

- Negative: - Often impatient
- Mixed: +/- Smarter than he seems, but still as friendly and excitable as you'd expect from a little dog.
- Has: Cinnamon is immortal (Curses rank 5 + agelessness and slow regeneration), and can be bonded as a familiar
Cinnamon was an ordinary dog a few decades ago before falling into wild rift, coming out the other side with human intelligence and completely immortal. Since then he's been bouncing around witchdom, tagging along with several different groups at times but never settling anywhere permanently. He's adventurous but not very ambitious, content to go with the flow and see where it takes him.

One of witchdom's most successful independent brokers, Victoria sits at the center of a vast web of money, favors, and information. Her personal power is actually fairly average, but she's leveraged her services into influence far beyond a typical solo witch. Has many descendants vieing for a place in the dynasty, especially after her most favored daughter disappeared a few decades ago.

An ancient blade of legend, Elysia has fought alongside heroes and shaped history many times. Once quite the revolutionary, seeing history repeat itself with new tyrants and some of her own allies corrupted by power caused her to withdraw from magical society. She hasn't taken a wielder since, but now travels the realms as a knight-errant, slaying evil and saving the helpless wherever she goes.

- Negative: - Doing so will also weaken her connection to you
- Mixed: +/- Thanks to inherited memories, considers herself to be an gestalt of everyone she consumes
- Has: Pandora has the equivalent of R5 Blue magic, Soul Graft (Husk), and Synthetic Hive
The base form of the Pandora swarm, now a blank slate with little personality beyond a strong curiosity about the world around her. By investing power, you can imprint her with a sense of loyalty to you, and be the one tasked with ensuring she doesn't try to take over the universe again. Over the next few years, she'll develop into an individual shaped by both what she's assimilated, and her own experiences.
