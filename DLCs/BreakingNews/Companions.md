Hestia runs a paketspace as a sort of sanctuary for anyone who requests it. She has covenant laws to prevent violence, but doesn't eject people except in extreme cases. Many come for protection from their enemies, or a neutral ground in mediating conflicts, but she also gets some visitors who just want to get away from it all for a while.
