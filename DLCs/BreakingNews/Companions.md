Beatrice has been living in the same small town for decades, right at a leyline nexus that draws all sorts of magical activity. By day, she's a pillar of the community, sitting on the town council, helping residents out, and sneaking them a bit of magical aid when she can get away with it.

- Mixed: +/- Leans toward a mentorship role in most of her interactions

Sigrid really lives up to the hermit image the Lydians sometimes have, living deep in the wilds with only spirits for company. She's the one behind the Serpent's Tongue pact, one of several divine bargains she's cemented as one of our top diplomats. Aescetic and contemplative, her idea of a perfect morning is waking up at 5 am to watch the sunrise in silence.

Hestia runs a pocketspace as a sort of sanctuary for anyone who requests it. She has covenant laws to prevent violence, but doesn't eject people except in extreme cases. Many come for protection from their enemies, or a neutral ground in mediating conflicts, but she also gets some visitors who just want to get away from it all for a while.

A greater auran anima embodying literature and the written word, Verse is known to be quite fond of mortals by spirit standards, finding them fascinating.

Their magic manifests as control over ink and paper, plus some more abstract abilities such as muselike inspiration.

Lysander is a divine emissary, a longtime agent of a god of death and fate. He works heavily with reapers, hunting down rogue spirits and those foreseen to threaten the larger fate of the Earth. Most of his targets are actively destructive, but he does sometimes have to hunt down innocent souls, whose life would lead to a butterfly effect that would threaten the weave of fate.

## Companion: Sylvie Bennet

That's me, the one who recorded this message. My familiar Kiri and I are reporters for the Lydian News Network. We're firm believers in freedom of information. Regardless of our factions, all of witchdom is better off if we all know what's going on in the world! I spend most of my time in the field, tracking down leads or chasing reports to get to the scene of an event before it's too late.
