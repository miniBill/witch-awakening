# The Element of Darkness

## Perk: You-Know-Who
- Class: Academic
- Element: Shadows
- Cost: 4

You will now be able to sense when you’re being scryed upon in real time, gaining cursory information about the person spying on you (the name they are most commonly known by, their general distance and direction from you, and how high rank their [Divination] is). You also gain a vague awareness of any instance of someone speaking your true name.


## Perk: Serpent's gaze
- Class: Sorceress
- Element: Shadows
- Cost: 6

This perk grants you the boon of the Gorgon’s, allowing you to affect people with magical effects from any range so long as you make eye contact with them (as a general guide for what this perk will or will not allow you to do, you can now consider eye-contact to be equivalent to physical contact for purposes of casting magic on someone).


## Perk: Babel
- Class: Sorceress
- Element: Shadows
- Cost: 4

You gain the ability to understand and be understood by any being capable of speaking. This can either manifest as the words being translated into the native language of whoever hears them, or as the meaning of the words being magically imparted without changing how they sound, and you may swap back and forth as you please. This perk does work for sign language, but does not work for any written language.


## Perk: Dark Vision
- Class: Academic
- Element: Shadows
- Cost: 2

Just what it says on the cover, get the ability to see in the dark, though only in monochrome. If you have ranks in [Shadow-Singing] you can see in colour, and are also able to see in magical darkness.


## Perk: Dramatic Flair
- Class: Warlock
- Element: Shadows
- Cost: 2

You are blessed with a supernatural gift for the dramatic, your magic manifesting in small ways to accentuate your mood. This can manifest in a near endless number of ways, some examples of what this might do include: lightning will striking in the background when you make a bold accusation, the lights beginning to flicker ominously when you are angered, the wind will picking up just in time to make your hair and cloak billow heroically, your voice will carrying much farther than it should when you make a speech. While it is nearly impossible to control how this perk manifests, it will always work in a way that underlines your current mood and/or actions. This perk can be toggled on and off at will.


## Perk: Pseudo-Skinwalker
- Class: Warlock
- Element: Shadows
- Cost: 6

With this perk you learn how to create ritually prepared skin-cloaks that allow you to shape-shift into animals. These cloaks must be large enough to cover 80% of your body, and need to be made primarily (50% or more) out of materials from the animal you want to shift into. Once donned you can shift at will into the animal the cloak is made from, gaining any magical abilities they have scaled to a max of Rank 3. You cannot shift partially, its an all-or-nothing deal.


## Perk: Pathways
- Class: warlock
- Element: Shadows
- Cost: 6

With this perk you can now trust in the shadows to guide you: when walking in complete darkness you may opt to be guided by shadows, getting ever closer to your goal, teleporting from one patch of darkness to another. This can guide you so long as you vaguely know where you’re going/want to go, but has the drawback that the shadows will sometimes redirect you somewhere they think you ought to go instead. Not as fast or reliable as portals, and doesn’t let you transport anything except what you carry, but this perk is cheaper, and can guide you to places you’ve not yet been to.


## Perk: Forbidden Knowledge
- Class: Academic
- Element: Shadows
- Cost: 5

You learn how to contact Whispers-In-The-Dark, an enigmatic entity that trades in secrets. If you offering it new knowledge it will gift you knowledge in return, though it wont always give you the specific knowledge you ask for. The Whispers-In-The-Dark knows a great deal of that which is ancient and lost, and will only ever tell speak truthfully, but be wary, for they are greedy and will do their best to make you come back to them for more. The truths they offer will almost always feel like a worthwhile trade, but the Whispers-In-The-Dark will try their best to lead you to situations in which you feel compelled to call upon them again.
