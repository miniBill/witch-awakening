# The Element of Darkness


## Relic: Shifting Sword
- Class: Sorceress
- Cost: 6

Initially appearing as just a fancy hilt, a Shifting Sword can extend a blade of liquid metal to take the shape of any bladed implement you could desire, from Dagger to Dao, Claymore to Katana. It takes less than a second for the blade to reshape itself, and it can be controlled mentally once you bond to it. A Shifting Sword channels mana very well, so don't hesitate to add some fancy effects to it mid-battle.
