# The Element of Darkness


## Relic: Shifting Sword
- Class: Sorceress
- Cost: 6

Initially appearing as just a fancy hilt, a Shifting Sword can extend a blade of liquid metal to take the shape of any bladed implement you could desire, from Dagger to Dao, Claymore to Katana. It takes less than a second for the blade to reshape itself, and can it can be controlled mentally once you bond to it. A Shifting Sword channels mana very well, so don't hesitate to add some fancy effects to it mid-battle.


## Relic: Pocket Lance
- Class: Warlock
- Cost: 6

A nasty surprise for anyone you fight, the pocket lance appears at first to be some bizarre implement with little use in a fight, but packs far more of a punch than you might expect. The point of the Pocket lance is actually only the tip of a full four-meter lance held within a tiny pocket dimension, that will thrust explosively forward should the side-sensors ever be pressed upon (and can later be retracted by channelling a small amount of mana into it).


## Relic: Flying dagger
- Class: Warlock
- Cost: 6

Usually made of mythril (though you may provide other materials for a smith to use), a flying dagger will, once bonded to, move according to the whims of it's owner, flying semi-autonomously through the air towards foes you designate. The dagger will draw on your mana to function, but only in tiny amounts.


## Relic: Gem Blade
- Class: Academic
- Cost: 6

A beautiful blade made of a single solid piece of crystal, and much heavier than it looks, a gem blade is a highly valuable asset for any aspiring battle-mage. While it is tough enough to be used in combat, its' real value is in its ability to store mana thanks to an internal expanded space that greatly increases its' volume. Each Gem Blade is capable of storing as much mana as a [High] storage capacity witch, and once someone has put mana into it, that person becomes the only one who will be able to draw mana from the Gem blade.


## Relic: Mansion Seed
- Class: Warlock
- Cost: 4

A Mansion Seed is the seed of a rather unique type of tree that, once planted, can be fed mana to rapidly grow into a huge living home complete will a full compliment of furnishings and magical facilities. Yep, it's a magical tree-house. These living homes will adapt themselves to the environment they find themselves in in order to somewhat match their surroundings. In the central room of these homes you will find a beautiful polished-wood chandelier, which will, once every 10 years, form a new Mansion Seed for you to use.


## Relic: Book of Blooms
- Class: Academic
- Cost: 4

The book of blooms is an enchanted book that offers a random assortment of seeds each day. Refreshing at dawn, the book of blooms will contain detailed information on a dozen random species of plant (both magical and mundane). By channelling your mana into the book while it is open to the illustration of one of the plants you can cause the book of blooms to create seeds for that species of plant. Roughly one out of four plants the books shows you will be magical, and any plant shown will be suitable for the environment you find yourself in (assuming any plants can grow there. If you are in a completely inhospitable environment, the book will just continue showing you plants from the most recent suitable environment it was in). The book of blooms is capable of showing you plants from other worlds, but these will be rarer.


## Relic: Clockwork Creature
- Class: Academic
- Cost: 2

The Clockwork Creatures are the work of a master golemancer/necromancer with a soft spot for animals. Each golem is custom-made for a terminally ill or elderly animal, and once Creature passes away, they will be re-summoned into their brand new and ageless body (complete with full range of senses, naturally). If you have a beloved pet you cannot bear to live without you may have a golem prepared for them so that they might be brought back. Alternatively, you may apply to adopt a Clockwork Creature who does not yet have a home. Note: despite being artificial, the golem bodies can be made to have soft fur/scales/whatever else covers their body, and are always made so that the resident soul can feel and appreciate pats.


## Relic: Painted World
- Class: Sorceress
- Cost: 10

Painted by a highly talented Wulong witch, a Painted World is a pocket dimension that can be accessed by stepping forward into the painting. Each painted world is unique, and each purchase of this relic will get you a painted world (custom to your specifications if you're having it made new, but you could also come into possession of an existing one). It is possible for plants, animals, and even people to live in a painted world (so long as it's been painted as something hospitable), but it takes a witch to move something into or out of the painting.
