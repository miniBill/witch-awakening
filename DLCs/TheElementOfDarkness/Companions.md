Elodie was a regular human hiking through the woods when she stumbled headfirst through a portal to the Faewilds. Having more than a little camping experience, she managed to survive a month in the enchanted wilds before a wandering Archfey came across her; impressed by her tenacity, and pleased by how politely she had asked for help getting somewhere safe, the capricious Fey lord granted Elodie's wish by turning her into a witch so that she'd have enough power to be safe wherever she roamed. Elodie eventually got picked up by a wondering Lodge agent and offered an apprenticeship, which she gratefully accepted.
