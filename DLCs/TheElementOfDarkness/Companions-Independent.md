Edward has learned a moderate amount about the magical world by eavesdropping on the conversations in his fathers shop, and now his dream is to bring about societal  reforms across the magical world, to free the Dolls from their servitude, to end slavery on New Olympus, to institute a constitution democracy in Alfheimr, and to see discrimination against outsiders brought to an end. His lack of understanding in several key areas will likely lead to a rather rude awakening in due time.

She comes from a prominent and highly influential witch family, but really doesn't like to talk about it, ever, please and thank you. Some might say carrying packages to and fro is beneath the scion of a powerful magical bloodline, but Michele is happy where she is and has no interest whatsoever in gaining magical might or accumulating favours, she just wants to travel across the world and deliver her packages to interesting places while meeting people.

Bethany Davina was nearly the victim of a monster-attack, and had it not been for the O.R.C. Exterminator already on the beast's trail she would certainly not have survived. Amazed by the power and beauty of her saviour, and with the veil of the masquerade now lifted for her, Bethany has been obsessed with all things witch-related since that fateful day, and now spends most of her free time tracking (totally not stalking she swears) any and all witches she can find, and gossiping about their lives with other in-the-know mundanes. Her dream is to someday become an intern, employee (or just maybe, a sidekick!) to a powerful witch, preferably one who shares lots of juicy witch-related gossip.

Francisca, or Fran to her friends, was once a part of a cross-faction task-force dedicated to containing Outsider outbreaks. She was a front-line fighter, facing down horrors beyond comprehension, fending off inter-dimensional invasions, saving the world (or at least small parts of it), all that was just another Tuesday to her. Unfortunately, even with the greatest care taken, outsider corruption catches up to everyone who interacts with them long enough, and after a particularly brutal fight that left her wounded and overexposed Fran was forced to retire to a quiet and peaceful life before she became fully corrupted. Regular meditation and therapy sessions have helped a great deal with the voices, and Fran is confident she'll be completely free of them in time, but for now she's quite happy with her new career making magitech prostheses.

Issac Ashwell is the proprietor of a magic antiquities shop that deals primarily in magical artifacts, of both the common household variety and (for the right customer) the rare and potent sort. He is a more powerful witch than you might expect a humble shopkeeper to be, and while he usually acquires the artifacts he sells by buying them off of other witches, he has on occasion been known to delve promising ruins himself. Issac has a son, Edward, whom he raised by himself after the tragic death of his wife. Issac is afraid that Edward might get himself overly involved in the magical community and end up in harms way, and as such, has tried to keep his son away from magic whenever possible, with the exception of giving him some protective artifacts.
