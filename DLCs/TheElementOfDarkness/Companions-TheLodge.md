Elodie was a regular human hiking through the woods when she stumbled headfirst through a portal to the Faewilds. Having more than a little camping experience, she managed to survive a month in the enchanted wilds before a wandering Archfey came across her; impressed by her tenacity, and pleased by how politely she had asked for help getting somewhere safe, the capricious Fey lord granted Elodie’s wish by turning her into a witch so that she’d have enough power to be safe wherever she roamed. Elodie eventually got picked up by a wondering Lodge agent and offered an apprenticeship, which she gratefully accepted.

Orphaned at a young age, Aveline is the survivor of an abusive foster home where her mundane parents used and abused her and her fellow siblings for profit. When a particularly bad day triggered Aveline’s awakening as a witch her tormentors, just then finding out magic is real, saw it as an opportunity to become rich and tried to sell her offto the highest bidder. Luckily they were as stupid as they were cruel, completely failing to cover their tracks, and a member of the local Lodge Cabal managed to track them down and rescue Aveline and her sibling. Now the newest member of her Cabal, Aveline is adjusting to life in a safe environment, and dreams of someday working alongside O.R.C. to help others in hopeless situations.


## Companion: Ingvild Dagny

- Power: 6
- Teamwork: 2
- Sociability: 7
- Morality: 7
- Has: Ingvild has Reinforcement 3, Portals 3, Concealment 3

Don’t be fooled, underneath that helmet there’s a whole nest of snake-hair (the helmet serves both to protect Ingvild’s snakes and to keep them at a comfy temperature). A centurion hunter for a Faewild cabal, Ingvild’s specialty is the neutralization and transportation of rare and dangerous creatures by using her abilities as a Gorgon to transform them into golden statues that can later be revived (or smashed, as the situation demands). In her spare time this huntress likes to binge TV shows and movies, or work in her private garden (filled with all manner of life-like golden statues).


## Companion: Rose
- Faction: The Lodge
- Cost: 8
- Race: Hollow
- Class: Sorceress
- Quote: _*“If I have to tell you to get away from the windows oNE MORE TIME I SWEAR...”-Rose, shortly before tying her employer up for their own good.*_
- Positive: + Renowned bodyguard, will defend her charge no matter what
- Positive: + You will never meet a better poker player, bluffing champion
- Negative: - Overprotective, her clients often feel stifled

- Power: 7
- Teamwork: 9
- Sociability: 5
- Morality: 3
- Has: Rose has Countermagic 4, Portals 3, Lifeweaving 2, and _Mythril Armor_

As a career bodyguard working for her cabal since the late 1600s, Rose is one of the best in the Biz when it comes to keeping a charge alive, no matter how squishy, air-headed, or generally drawn to harm they usually are. She has thwarted countless assassination attempts, deflected death in the thick of innumerable battles, and shot down a seemingly endless series of incredibly stupid ideas from her employers that would likely have lead to their demise. Rose doesn’t like chatting about her life from before she was a witch and will describe it as boring and generally miserable if pushed; she will, however, gladly regale you with stories from her various jobs.


## Companion: Cathrine Zarina
- Faction: The Lodge
- Cost: 6

- Teamwork: 6
- Sociability: 3
- Morality: 9
- Has: Cathrine has Aethernautics 4, Portal 4, Wands 3

Former member of Hawthorne academy, Cathrine found the academic environment to be far too stifling, and as soon as she felt confident enough to she dropped out to find a life of exploration and adventure. Now a Pathfinder for the Lodge, she has found her place in the world, exploring new worlds, encountering strange new civilizations and embarking on epic quests. Cathrine has a bit of a saviour complex, and won’t turn down any opportunity to play the hero, to save the day, to vanquish the great evil! It helps that she has the backing of a powerful mercenary guild looking to reach new customers.

As it stands Lenneth already has a loyal following of students and former students who have all agreed to go with her when she finally takes the leap, as well as the backing of her current Cabal’s matriarch.


## Companion: Gratianus “Grant” Tertullian
- Faction: The Lodge
- Cost: 15
- Race: Daeva
- Class: Academic
- Quote: _*“Hmf, not bad, keep it up.” - Grant, trying to hide how thrilled he was to see his student’s brilliant use of elementalism.*_

- Positive: + More experience teaching new witches than you’re likely to find anywhere else
- Positive: + A long history with many contacts
- Negative: - Loves new technology, though he rarely understands it
- Negative: - May have been the one to wipe-out Pompeii in order to stop an outsider incursion. Still haunts him

- Power: 8
- Teamwork: 7
- Sociability: 5
- Morality: 5

Gratianus, or Grant to those that know him, is a very old member of the Lodge, a recruit from it’s earlier days, and currently the patriarch of his own Cabal. Once upon a time, back when he was a young man, Grant was a ruthless mercenary, taking any contract that promised violence and glory. These days he has mellowed significantly and cringes at any mention of his young and bloodthirsty self. He has long moved past the regret and shame of his younger self’s actions, but the embarrassment brought on by thinking about how edgy he used to be lingers. Grant favours an elemental type of ash-magic by combining [Firecalling], [Windkeeping], and [Earthmoving], and actively encourages others to try out new and potent combinations of elementalism. He spends most of his time these days teaching newer members of his Cabal, finding vicarious happiness in the success and growth of those he mentors.


## Companion: Nazli Mojdeh
- Faction: The Lodge
- Cost: 10
- Race: Lamia

- Positive: + Laid back when off the clock, highly attentive on the job
- Positive: + Only takes one neophyte student at a time, so they receive her full attention and care

- Negative: - Has high expectations for her students, will push them hard
- Mixed: +/- Built-in storage compartment/holding cell
- Power: 8
- Teamwork: 7
- Sociability: 6
- Morality: 4

A venerable contractor who specializes in bounty-hunting, Nazli is currently on retainer for O.R.C. using her talents to track down dangerous criminals, and those who commit serious violations of the masquerade. She keeps a sidekick at all times, a junior Lodge member who serves as both apprentice and intern for her. Nazli is what you might call a roguish character, a charmer with a quick wit, and would fit right in on the pages of any number of noir detective books (discounting the fact that she’s half-serpent, or course).


## Companion: “Old” Arthur Hadford
- Faction: The Lodge
- Cost: 5
- Race: Neutral
- Quote: _*“Some people say I ain’t all there in the head as if it’s a bad thing, they don’t get how fun life can be when yer a bit of a kook” - ‘Old’ Arthur.*_
- Has: Arthur has _Ageless_, a _Rift Switch-Blade_, and a _bottle of bottomless moonshine_.
- Positive: + Doesn’t age, or seem to have any negative health conditions
- Positive: + Could thrive indefinitely out in the wilderness of most worlds, so long as he had a good supply of pepper
- Negative: - Was already a curmudgeonly old man when he stopped aging
- Negative: - Has some odd sensibilities, and is quite superstitious
- Mixed: +/- Can, and will, cook up a delicious meal out of the most horrifying of monsters
- Power: 0
- Teamwork: 8
- Sociability: 3
- Morality: 6

Working along-side pathfinders as a guide and scout, Arthur is an eccentric old man incapable of wielding magic, and who is more knowledgeable when it comes to wilderness survival than anyone else you’re ever likely to meet. there’s also the small detail that he has been working for the Lodge since the early 1800s, and hasn’t aged a day since signing up. Curious as to why it is that he doesn’t age? Well, unfortunately there’s no way of knowing, as Arthur gives a different story anytime he’s asked about it, or about any part of his background and early life. A mystery, wrapped in an enigma, wrapped in a threadbare coat that has somehow, against all odds, survived the countless expeditions he’s been on.


## Companion: Helen Corinna
- Faction: The Lodge
- Cost: 15
- Race: Jackalope
- Class: Sorceress
- Quote: _*“No, no, really *(muffled snort)*, that herb will help to grow your power. Come now, would I lie to you?” -Helen, offering a potent laxative to a suspicious subordinate.*_
- Positive: + Ancient and wise
- Positive: + Knows clever tips and tricks for using any and all sorts of magic
- Negative: - Very out of touch with modern technology
- Negative: - Plays pranks on her subordinates
- Mixed: +/- Speaks in riddles whenever possible, the fact that this annoys people only encourages her to do it more
- Power: 9
- Teamwork: 7
- Sociability: 6
- Morality: 8
- Has: ShadowSinging 5, Timewarping 5, Hexes 5, Alchemy 4

A matriarch of great power and experience, Helen was one of the original founding members of the Lodge, and one of only 3 to survive into the modern era. She has a well earned reputation for being a handful, mostly due to her tenancy to cause trouble for fun when she gets bored. As a matriarch she has less of a direct leading role, and acts more as the wise old grandma to her underlings, albeit a wise old grandma who loves to stir the pot at every given opportunity. Despite her chaotic nature she is still a highly valuable member of the Lodge who knows when it’s time to get serious.
