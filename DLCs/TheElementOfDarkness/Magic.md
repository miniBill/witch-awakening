# The Element of Darkness

## Magic: Shadow-Singing
- Class: Sorceress
- Elements: Shadows, Earth + Water
- Elementalism: True

The elemental magic of shadow, Shadow Singing will allow you to repel light, blanket an area in darkness, or turn the shadows corporeal. Very handy if you want to look intimidating, to disorient someone, to make a shield spring out of nothing, or if you want to murder someone in the edgiest way possible.

### Rank 1
At rank 1 you are granted the ability to __Blend__ better into shadows, and to __Strengthen__ shadows to be resistant to illumination. Become difficult to see when in darkness, or cause a candle to illuminate a fraction of what it should.

### Rank 2
At rank 2 you are now able to __Conjure__ shadows, causing them to extend from any natural shadow outwards wherever you please. Blanket a room or corridor in darkness, cause an average flashlight to only be able to illuminate a few feet.

### Rank 3
At rank 3 your __Strengthen__ now allows shadows to interact with physical objects, and are now even harder to illuminate. Physical shadows are rigid and fragile, like glass. You can choose to __Strengthen__ shadows without making them physical. __Conjure__ now lets you create a larger volume of shadows. Walk across a bridge of shadow, blanket a house in darkness. Cause a high-end flashlight to be unable to pierce more than a few feet.

### Rank 4
At rank 4 __Strengthen__ will improve shadows even further, making them tougher and more resistant. Physical shadows can now be somewhat tougher and more flexible, like bamboo. __Conjure__ could cover a skyscraper now. Make a searchlight unable to illuminate more than a few meters ahead. __Blend__ now lets you partially merge with shadows, causing physical attacks to pass through you (doesn’t work on anything magic).

### Rank 5
At rank 5 __Strengthen__ makes shadows extremely resilient, physical shadows can now behave like a non-Newtonian fluid (becomes more resilient as more force gets applied to it). __Conjure__ could blanket a town in shadows. __Blend__ lets you take shadow-form at will, becoming intangible and allowing limited flight while in darkness. Your shadows are now Light-Drinking, becoming stronger when illuminated. No amount of non-magical light will be enough to push back your shadows.


## Magic: Blighting
- Class: Sorceress
- Elements: Necro, Nature + Shadows
- Elementalism: True

The elemental magic of decay, Blighting is a potent and highly destructive magic that causes weathering and decay in that which it effects. For every rank in Blighting you will find the effects of aging and weathering to be reduced by 50% in a small radius around you, though never quite fully becoming immune (your clothes will take far longer to become worn down, your tools will not rust or grow dull nearly as easily, and should you belong to a species that ages, you will find the ill effects of age to be greatly reduced).

### Rank 1
At rank 1 you can __Accelerate__ non-living materials, causing them to age at up to twice natural speed. Handy for those who own a wine cellar. 

### Rank 2
At rank 2 you can inflict __Blight__ in the form of a ray of energy (coloured like a murky-black version of your aura) on dead organic matter to cause it to rapidly rot and decay. Makes for a very unpleasant surprise if you use this on the wooden supports of a house. The undead are resistant, but not immune to __Blight__. A fallen tree would rot away within a minute.

### Rank 3
At rank 3 __Accelerate__ can now speed up the aging of non-living matter by up to ten times its natural speed. __Blight__ can now cause inorganic matter to rapidly rust/weather/wear-down. A door’s hinges could be made to rust away, bricks would crumple to dust etc. Materials affects speed of decay (stainless steel would last a lot longer than iron, for example), but even the most weathering-resistant substances will eventually crumble to __Blight__.

### Rank 4
At rank 4 your __Blight__ is accelerated further, and can now affect living beings causing their health to rapidly deteriorate. __Blight__ won’t kill someone by itself, but it would make them incredibly vulnerable. At this rank the undead are no longer resistant to __Blight__.

### Rank 5
At rank 5 __Accelerate__ can now cause something to age at 100 times its natural speed. __Blight__ now works extremely quickly, make someone infirm in moments, cause a brand-new skyscraper to decay and collapse before your eyes, make a forest wither away before you. You additionally gain resistance to radiation, and the ability to dramatically increase something’s rate of __atomic decay__ (meaning you can take radioactive stuff, and make it WAY more radioactive). Do be careful of the masquerade, modern mortals tend to notice sudden spikes of radiation. 


## Magic: Concealing
- Class: Warlock
- Elements: Shadows, Body, Mind
- Elementalism: False

A form of magic closely related to Psychotics, Concealing is a school of magic that will allow you to prevent others from noticing you. It isn’t true invisibility, it’s more akin to a field of magic that makes it difficult to focus on you or the things you do. 

### Rank 1
At rank 1 Concealing will allow you become __Indistinct__, causing eyes pass over you easily. This isn’t perfect, and won’t work at all if you draw attention to yourself, but otherwise people wont remember having seen you. __Indistinct__ doesn’t work forever, and overexposure will increase a person’s level of resistance, at which point it will drop down to the previous rank’s __Indistinct__, or if already at rank 1, cease to work on that person entirely (a person will slowly become vulnerable again given time, every 12 hours removing a level of resistance). Rank 1 indistinct could work on someone for up to one hour before they gain resistance to it.

### Rank 2
At rank 2 __Indistinct__ becomes stronger, allowing you to avoid someone’s notice so long as you don’t get up in their personal space. Rank 2 __Indistinct__ might work on someone for roughly 30 minutes before they gain resistance.

### Rank 3
At rank 3 __Indistinct__ would work on someone so long as you don’t bump into them. you learn to apply __Indistinct__ to other objects or people. You are now __Shrouded__, granted a passive immunity to being spotted by [Divination] of any rank below your [Concealing] rank. Rank 3 __Indistinct__ would work for 15 minutes before causing someone to gain resistance. 

### Rank 4
At rank 4 __Indistinct__ now makes it difficult to focus on you, even after having drawn someone’s attention they will struggle to make out anything more that the vaguest details about you. Rank 4 __indistinct__ could work on someone for 5 minutes before their mind adapts and it loses effectiveness.

### Rank 5
At rank 5 __Indistinct__ now makes it virtually impossible to make out any detail of you. Rank 5 __Indistinct__ can actually draw someone’s attention, as you’re effectively a walking void of information, and would only work for 1 minute before becoming ineffectual. __Shrouded__ can now work on [Divination] of equal rank, but only while actively using __Indistinct__. 


## Magic: Stellarism
- Class: Sorceress
- Elements: Shadows, Life, Fire
- Elementalism: False

Not to be confused with Aethernautics, though synergizing well with it, Stellarism is a magic that deals solely with channelling the power of the stars, manifesting starlight as a weapon, or weaving matter from it.

### Rank 1
At rank 1 you gain small bonuses when __Under Starlight__, translating to a small increase in healing speed, improved stamina, and mana generation methods being slightly better. For the purposes of this school of magic sunlight does not qualify as starlight, and will interfere with the effects of __Under Starlight__. As a general rule, if you can see the stars with the naked eye, then you are __Under Starlight__.

### Rank 2
At rank 2 you can __Emanate__ starlight as a light-source. Starlight from __Emanate__ hurts the eyes of monsters, but causes no physical harm.

### Rank 3
At rank 3 [Stellarism] now requires half as much mana when you are __Under Starlight__. The starlight you __Emanate__ can now stun and disorient beings you use it against, roughly equivalent to a magical flash-bang. __Weave__ starlight into star-silk, a weightless cloth that’s as soft like silk and as tough as Kevlar.

### Rank 4
At rank 4 your __Emanate__ will now cause the muscles of those affected to spasm. In addition, you can now __Distill__ starlight into Liquid-Nebula, a colourful and potent magical reagent. Aside from being a valuable alchemical ingredient, anyone who drinks a cup of Liquid-Nebula will count as being __Under Starlight__ for the next 12 hours. Drinking Liquid-Nebula will also cause a person’s hair to gently glow a myriad of ever-shifting colours

### Rank 5
At rank 5 the effects of __Emanate__ will linger for several minutes after exposure. You can now __Forge__ Starlight into Stellarite, a very tough yet flexible celestial metal with several interesting properties. Stellarite begins as fairly lightweight, but it’s weight can be increased or decreased by channelling mana through it. In addition, a damaged or deformed Stellarite item will repair itself while starlight is shining upon it. Stellarite is a darker metal that can come in any colour that stars shine. You are now able to channel a __Starlight Aspect__, for 15 seconds you will be intangible and completely immune to magic, and you will instantly refill your mana reserves. This ability can only be used once before needing to be recharged, and can be recharged by meditating under starlight for four or more hours. While __Under Starlight__, __Starlight Aspect__ will instead last one minute.

## Magic: Augmentation
- Class: Academic
- Elements: Shadows, Blood, Metal
- Elementalism: False

The magic that [Integration] is loosely based upon, augmentation is the practice of crafting magi-tech implants, piercings, and limbs and binding them to a living being. Artifacts made through Augmentation offer a wide range of benefits to those who have them, from bestowing simple cantrips, to making medical aids, to boosting your magic. A person’s body can support one Augment from a rank above their highest rank magic, and twice as many for each rank below that, (eg: someone with no magical ability could support one rank 0 Augments, someone with Rank 1 magic could have one rank 2 Augment, two rank 1 Augments, and four rank 0 Augments). If you go beyond this limit your Augments will stop working and you’ll get a headache.

### Rank 1
At rank 1 you learn to craft __Augments__ in the form of Piercings which can grant any one effect from rank 1 magics you know. The main benefit of Piercings over other forms of magical artifices is the wearer con toggle to the effects on and off at will. Some examples of what you could grant with Augmentation R1 include: heat resistance from [Firecalling], a toggle-able courage boost from [Runes], or a bound Imp you can summon at will from [Consortation]. A rank 1 Augment costs K50 of common materials and reagents to create

### Rank 2
At rank 2 your __Augments__ can now grant any one effect from rank 2 magic you know. Alternatively, you may now instead grant the wearer of your Augment-artifice a perk you know with base cost 2P or less, increasing by 2P per every further rank of [Augmentation]. Not all perks can be granted in this way, only perks that affect the person wearing the artifice (so no “heritage” or “Magic friendship”), perks that do not effect the setting (no “Isekai” perks), and perks that are not Meta can be granted. Perks with requirements (Oracle, Menagerie, Improved familiar etc...) will only work for those who meet their requirements. A rank 2 Augment costs K500 of uncommon materials and reagents to create.

### Rank 3
At rank 3 your __Augments__ can now grant any one effect from rank 3 magic you know. Your __Augments__ can now take the form of magitech Prostheses, which don’t have any feeling, but give you an awareness of where they are and a yes/no sense of if they’re being touched. As a further alternative to granting effects or perks your __Augments__ can instead grant ranks in a magic you know, up to 2 ranks below you [Augmentation] rank. A rank 3 Augment costs K5000 of rare materials and reagents to create.

### Rank 4
At rank 4 your __Augments__ can now grant any one effect from rank 4 magic you know. You are not able to no merely replace missing body-parts with your Prostheses, but add entirely new ones. Give someone a second set of arms, or a pair of wings. You are now also able to incorporate artifacts into the prostheses you build (this uses up the artifact). A rank 4 Augment costs K50,000 of very rare materials and reagents to create.

### Rank 5
At rank 5 your __Augments__ can now grant any one effect from rank 5 magic you know. The prostheses you make can now relay sensory information of any variety. Make an eye that can see in ultraviolet, or an arm with an incredibly sophisticated sense of touch. As a final alternative, you learn how to make an amplifying Augment attuned to one school of magic, increasing the power of spell from that school by 50% when you cast through the Augment. A rank 5 Augment costs K500,000 of very rare or legendary materials and reagents to create.


## Magic: Saga-Calling
- Elements: Shadows, Soul, Wind
- Class: Academic
- Elementalism: False

There is power in stories, and Saga-Calling is the magic that will allow you to tap into this power. This school of magic will allow you to draw upon stories to manifest a wide array of effects and abilities, depending on the nature of the story you draw upon. Any story can qualify for use in Saga-Calling, but some are impractical. The better know a story is, the less mana it will require to use for your this magic (using an ancient fable known widely for a millennium would require minimal mana, whereas using someone’s fan-fiction that has been ready by five people and is only remembered by two would drain your magic reserves very rapidly). 

### Rank 1
At rank 1 you benefit from a drastically improved reading speed, and have an eidetic memory when it comes to remembering fiction.

### Rank 2
At rank 2 you become capable of comprehending any written or spoken word when reading or listening to a fictional/mythological tale (you understand them as the author/speaker intended them, so if the author/speaker misunderstood the meaning of a word they used, or made a word up, you’d know what they meant regardless).

### Rank 3
At rank 3 you are now able to __Draw__ strength from characters in a story, gaining a phantom version of their powers (these powers scale to Sage-Calling rank -1). This requires you to describe how you’re using these powers, narrating in the same style as the story you’re drawing from. Be careful not to reach for powers beyond you means, trying to use Saga-calling to give yourself otherwise impossible or godly powers will just result in a splitting headache.

### Rank 4
At rank 4 you can __Bind__ someone to a character from a story, and for as long as you maintain the spell the person will be drawn by fate to act out the role of the character (Romeo and Juliet would draw lovers to tragedy, Icarus would draw someone to falling to hubris, etc..). Be sure to brush up on both triumphs and tragedies, all the better to have the right tools for the situation.

### Rank 5
At rank 5 you can now Conjure __Ink-Phantoms__ from stories you know by heart, which take on the form of one of the characters and act out their role (this requires you to narrate their actions to some degree, as a way of guiding them). If the powers of these characters exceed R4 magic they scale down to R4. These characters cannot do anything that would not be possible through magic available to witches, and cannot grant wishes. Need a crime scene examined? _“There was no clue that could be devised, not by the poor witch so unfamiliar with the forensic profession, it was lucky then that she had the aid of the great detective: Sherlock Holmes”_. Need someone to accomplish an incredible feat of strength? _“The door was firmly locked and bolted, and the witch knew there was no way he could budge it, but for the mighty Herakles it was a trivial effort to tear the obstruction from its hinges”_.


## Magic: Shape-Shifting
- Elements: Shadows, Water, Beast
- Class: Warlock
- Elementalism: False
- Faction: The Lodge

The signature magic of the Lodge, Shape-Shifting allows one to mould their body to their whim, or even to take on features and traits from other species. Shape-Shifting is not permanent, and even should you not choose to shape-shift back into your regular form, your Witch’s true form will reassert itself over time. This also means that if a witch get shape-shifted against their will they will eventually return to normal.

### Rank 1
At rank 1 you can use shape-shifting to make purely cosmetic __Changes__, for example: changing skin/hair/eye colour, adding or removing freckles or birthmarks.

### Rank 2
At rank 2 you can make minor physical __Changes__, for example: changing your hair length, causing facial features to shift around, change the general build of your body, grow a bit shorter or taller. You can now temporarily increase or decrease your body-mass by up to 10%.

### Rank 3
At rank 3 __Changes__ to your body can be anything within the limitations of your species. You can now increase or decrease body-mass by up to 25%. You also learn how to craft __Shape-Talismans__, which allow your __Changes__ ability to grant you traits from animals. A __Shape-Talisman__ must be at least as large as a ring, must contain a part of the animal you wish to get traits from, and cannot contain parts from more than one animal (else your magic will be confused and things will get messy). At this rank your __Shape-Talisman__ will enable you may take on a variety of helpful traits, such as the eyes of a hawk for improved vision, the nose of a dog for better sense of smell, or an octopus’s suckers to help cling to a wall. These traits can make up a maximum of 10% of your body-mass. You may carry any number of __Shape-talismans__, though you must make them yourself as each talisman will only function for their creator. 

### Rank 4
At rank 4 you become capable of __Shift-Healing__, using __Changes__ to mend yourself. __Shift Healing__ works by moving your body-mass around to fix wounds, and can mend such things as broken bones, lacerations, puncture wounds etc, but cannot heal cell-damage (for example, it wouldn’t work on: a sunburn, blood-loss, liver damage from poison etc). Your __Shape-Talismans__ will now enable you to manifest the natural weapons of their animals, and you could, for example: grow a vipers fangs, a werewolf’s claws, or a scorpions sting. Animal traits can now make up a maximum of 25% of your body-mass at any one time, and you can now increase or decrease your body-mass by up to 50%.

### Rank 5
At rank 5 you learn __Mimicry__, and become able to shape-shift into a perfect replica of someone you’ve touched within the past 48 hours. Your __Shape-Talismans__ now enable you to manifest any magical abilities their animal might have possessed so long as they’re in some way connected to a trait you’ve manifested from that creature (a manticor’s venom, a unicorn’s healing blood, a werewolf’s resistance to non-silvered weapons etc. Things like: a phoenix’s ability to resurrect, a vampire’s ability to turn to mist, or whatever magic that creature may have happened to learn do not count). If any of these abilities surpass rank 4 magic, they are scaled down to rank 4 (no giving yourself limitless power because you got your hands on an Elder-Dragon scale). Animal traits can now make up a maximum of 50% of your body-mass, and you may now increase or decrease your body-mass by up to 95%.
