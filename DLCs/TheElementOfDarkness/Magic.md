# The Element of Darkness

## Magic: Shadow-Singing
- Class: Sorceress
- Elements: Shadows, Earth + Water
- Elementalism: True

The elemental magic of shadow, Shadow Singing will allow you to repel light, blanket an area in darkness, or turn the shadows corporeal. Very handy if you want to look intimidating, to disorient someone, to make a shield spring out of nothing, or if you want to murder someone in the edgiest way possible.

### Rank 1
At rank 1 you are granted the ability to __Blend__ better into shadows, and to __Strengthen__ shadows to be resistant to illumination. Become difficult to see when in darkness, or cause a candle to illuminate a fraction of what it should.

### Rank 2
At rank 2 you are now able to __Conjure__ shadows, causing them to extend from any natural shadow outwards wherever you please. Blanket a room or corridor in darkness, cause an average flashlight to only be able to illuminate a few feet.

### Rank 3
At rank 3 your __Strengthen__ now allows shadows to interact with physical objects, and are now even harder to illuminate. Physical shadows are rigid and fragile, like glass. You can choose to __Strengthen__ shadows without making them physical. __Conjure__ now lets you create a larger volume of shadows. Walk across a bridge of shadow, blanket a house in darkness. Cause a high-end flashlight to be unable to pierce more than a few feet.

### Rank 4
At rank 4 __Strengthen__ will improve shadows even further, making them tougher and more resistant. Physical shadows can now be somewhat tougher and more flexible, like bamboo. __Conjure__ could cover a skyscraper now. Make a searchlight unable to illuminate more than a few meters ahead. __Blend__ now lets you partially merge with shadows, causing physical attacks to pass through you (doesn't work on anything magic).

### Rank 5
At rank 5 __Strengthen__ makes shadows extremely resilient, physical shadows can now behave like a non-Newtonian fluid (becomes more resilient as more force gets applied to it). __Conjure__ could blanket a town in shadows. __Blend__ lets you take shadow-form at will, becoming intangible and allowing limited flight while in darkness. Your shadows are now Light-Drinking, becoming stronger when illuminated. No amount of non-magical light will be enough to push back your shadows.
