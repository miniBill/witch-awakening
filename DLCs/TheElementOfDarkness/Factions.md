# The Element of Darkness

## Faction: The Lodge
- Motto: Monster Hunters and Mercenaries

The Lodge originated as a guild of witches-for-hire in Constantinople during the twilight years of the Roman empire, serving as bodyguards, court mystics, and monster-hunters for a wide variety of notable figures. In the present day The Lodge serves much the same role, an organization of Witches who hire themselves out to the highest bidder as highly competent guards, advisors, and/or hunters. 

The Lodge is divided into a number of cabals, disparate groups who operate independently of each other, and who all participate in a democratic central council whenever a matter concerning the entirety of the Lodge needs to be addressed. A cabal's hierarchy is divided into a variety of roles. __Neophytes__ are newly inducted members still learning the ropes, each one working under a specific mentor. In order to enter the Lodge and become a Neophyte you would need to catch the eye of a Venerable to mentor you. __Journey-mages__ are neophytes who have graduated to being full members of the cabal. Journey-mages are loosely divided into the contractors, who tend to hire themselves out to other organizations, and the hunters, who focus on exploration new worlds and exploiting their resources. __Pathfinders__ are members of the cabal who have [Portals] R4+ and are charged with creating portkeys and/or portals to and from worlds useful to the cabal, or [Aethernautics] 4+ who are charged with seeking out and exploring worlds with natural resources valuable to the cabal. Witches capable of being pathfinders are rare and highly valued, if you have either of these magics you would have a very easy time getting into whichever cabal you please. __Centurions__ are Journey-mages who have been with the cabal for more than a century. The __Venerable__ are centurions who have chosen to focus on mentoring neophytes. __Praetorians__ are centurions who serve as the right hand of a cabal's leader. The __Matriarch__ (or on occasion, Patriarch) is the leader who will guide a cabal and represent it on meetings of the central council, usually (but not always) its' most senior member.

Each Cabal has it's own rules and culture to some degree, but there is belief that is universal across the lodge: a contract is sacred. Any member of the Lodge that breaks their end of an agreement risks being excommunicated if they cannot provide a very good reason for their actions, and should a client break their end of an agreement they will be blacklisted, no member of the Lodge will doing business with them from that point onward.

### Location
The cabals of the Lodge are spread across the world, with most having their central base of operations somewhere in the countryside near large population centres. Each cabal has a jealously guarded registry of valuable worlds their pathfinders have uncovered, worlds the cabals use both as a source of valuable materials, and as training grounds where Neophytes are taught all the tools of the trade. These worlds are where Journey-mages who work as hunters go to hunt and/or capture valuable beasts, or to retrieve valuable herbs and minerals.

### Relations
- Arcadia: The Lodge has yet to work with or against Arcadia. 
- Hawthorne: Hawthorne Academy is an occasional customer of the Lodge, usually to either find and retrieve a rare specimen, or to act as guards on lengthy field-trips. On a few occasions Lodge members have been hired on as teachers, or as teaching assistants.
- Watchers: Relations between the Watchers and the Lodge are very poor currently. After an undercover Watcher Agent stole a dangerous relic from a Hespatian family they had a bounty placed on them. Unaware of the target's affiliation, Lodge hunters tried to collect, but when they cornered their target they were ambushed by a team of Inquisitors, resulting in the real-death of several members of the Lodge, some of them quite senior. There's no open conflict, in part because the Lodge doesn't have anywhere near the numbers needed to get back at the Watchers, but the tension is there, and at present no Lodge member would be caught dead working for a Watcher.
- Hespatia: The Lodge deals with Hespatia on a family-by-family basis, some are excellent and favoured customers, some have been blacklisted.
- Lunabella: Relations between Lunabella and the Lodge are distant, though not especially unfriendly. It's simply that Lunabella has little need of the Lodge's services.
- Alfhiemr: The Alfhiemr Alliance are long-time favoured customers, with both the summer and winter courts make frequent and often long term contracts with members of the Lodge.
- Outsiders: Members of the Lodge see the killing of outsider-corrupted beings as a major accomplishment, and trophies of such hunts are often (and carefully) displayed as marks of status among senior members of the Lodge.
- ORC: The Lodge tends to view O.R.C.s as pencil-pushing busy-bodies, and O.R.C. Tends to view Lodge members as thugs in suits. Still, on the rare occasion O.R.C. has hired Lodge members they've been model customers.
- Alphazon: A number of Alphazon executives have made use of Lodge members as body-guards and hired muscle who can be relied upon to not be compromised by the machinations of their corporate rivals.

### Perk: Lodge Guidebook
A deceptively thin Magical book that contains the sum total of all knowledge in the records of the Lodge. From client history to maps to monster weak-spots the Lodge Guidebook will always open to the exact page you need. To anyone other than you the guidebook will appear to be blank. Any member of the lodge may add to the guidebook, and this has resulted in a staggering about of random trivia and survival info being added in. In order to get a Guidebook you must swear a binding oath to never enter any information you know to be false (opinions and theories may be entered, but only with the appropriate caveats).

As a member of the Lodge you may find yourself working for one faction more others (you may take the quests of any one faction, other than the outsiders, as if you were a member of that faction).
