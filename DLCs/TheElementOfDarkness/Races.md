# The Element of Darkness

## Race: Nightgaunt
- Elements: Shadows, Soul
- Mana capacity: High
- Mana rate: Low

Nightgaunts are beings of elemental darkness who take on the shape of another
species of witch (though none of their abilities, unless you're a hybrid/chimera of that species). A Nightgaunt casts a particularly dark shadow, regardless of light-level. If cut, a Nightgaunt will bleed Shade-Blood, a viscous liquid shadow that dissipates under light (this is a somewhat valuable R3 alchemical reagent). While hidden in shadows a Nightgaunt becomes partially melded with them, making physical attacks against them less effective, and slowly healing them of any wounds. A Nightgaunt ages like a human, but while in darkness they will age in reverse at twice their normal rate of aging (this wont work before they're adults, and won't bring them back to pre-adulthood). If slain a Nightgaunt can be brought back to life by placing them in perfect darkness, after which their body will heal and they will re-awaken. Beware however, once dead light will cause a Nightgaunt's body to begin to disintegrate, so get them somewhere dark quickly.

__Nightgaunts draw Mana__ from Darkness. While in light-levels too low for an ordinary human to see in a Nightgaunt will continuously generate a Low charge of mana. If in absolute darkness with no visible light whatsoever this will increase to a Medium charge.

### Perk: My Shadow
- Cost: 4

A Nightgaunt with their species perk casts an extremely dark shadow regardless
of what sources of light there are. This shadow can be controlled by the Nightgaunt, and is capable of separating from its host. A Nightgaunt controlling their shadow can see and hear whatever is going on around the shadow (though they can't see colour), and is capable of casting magic through it as though it were a familiar. When a Nightgaunt stops controlling this shadow it will dissolve and reappear attached once more to its host.


## Race: Amazon Dryad
- Elements: Nature, Shadows
- Mana capacity: Medium
- Mana rate: Low

Putting the Venus in Venus-flytrap, Amazon-Dryads are a carnivorous Dryad
subspecies that enjoy a symbiotic relationship with carnivorous plants of all kinds. This subspecies often has leaves and twigs like a regular Dryad, but will also sometimes have Flesh-eating plants like Venus Flytraps and Pitcher Plants incorporated into their anatomy. Amazon-Dryads are capable of rooting themselves in place, growing an interconnected garden of carnivorous plants from their roots. Whenever the Amazon-Dryad roots themselves after growing a garden they can choose to either magically transport their existing garden to their current location, or to grow a new garden (in which case the old garden becomes a purely mundane collection of plants). A garden starts out at a few meters across, but may, over time, grow up to an acre in size. An Amazon-Dryad ages normally, but when rooted will de-age at 10x the speed they normally age. When slain they will begin to regrow withing a pod under the roots of their garden, reaching the equivalent of an 8 year old human after 3 months, and regaining their memories throughout the following week.

__Amazon-Dryads draw Mana__ from Nutrition. Whenever a plant in their garden catches prey they will receive a low charge of mana. An Amazon-Dryad may bring an animal carcass to feed their garden (the body will be dragged below by the roots, and its nutrients will be absorbed swiftly) they will instead receive a continuous medium charge of mana instead. This medium charge will last until the garden finishes getting all the nutrients out of the body, and as such, larger animals will last longer (a human body would last roughly 24 hours on average, for reference).

### Perk: Diverse garden
- Cost: 4

With this perk an Amazon-Dryad may incorporate any plant they have
previously come into contact with into their garden, not just carnivorous ones. Magical plants will take longer to grow, proportional to how potent their magic is.


## Race: Nightlight
- Elements: Life, Shadows
- Mana capacity: Low
- Mana rate: Low

Appearing human for the most part, Nightlights are easily distinguished by the bio-luminescent swirling patterns found across their body (not all Nightlights are completely covered in these patterns, but some are). Similar to a fingerprint, each Nightlight's patterns are unique to them. Nightlights have a natural aura of calm and peace, radiating positive emotion. This aura is dependant on their own emotional state, the happier they are the more powerful it is and the brighter the patterns on their skin will glow. When a nightlight dies a small sphere of light will coalesce above their body. Though it is weightless and ethereal, if someone cups their hand around the sphere it can be moved. Whenever someone experiences positive emotions near to the sphere it will get slightly larger and brighter, until eventually it bursts in a spectacular light-show to reveal the nightlight, revived and in the prime of their life.

__Nightlights draw Mana__ from Illumination. When a nightlight is the only source of light in the dark they gain a constant low mana charge. This charge increases slightly for every other person who they provide illumination for.

### Perk: Heartwarming
- Cost: 6

Nightlights with this perk gain a second charge method: whenever you manage to improve someone's mood in any way you gain up to a High charge of mana, with more drastic improvements leading to greater amounts of mana.


## Race: Gearheart
- Elements: Metal, Shadows
- Mana capacity: Medium
- Mana rate: Medium

Gearhearts are a subspecies of Doll whose bodies function through the use of magi-tech clockwork. They vary greatly in appearance, but will always show some sign of what they are (seams, exposed gears, audible ticking etc...). Originating from experimentation on doll creation by renaissance witches, Gearhearts benefit from perfect precision of motion and truly inhuman dexterity, but lack the innate tenancy towards servitude common to other Dolls. All Gearhearts have an internal clock which grants them a keen awareness of the passage of time. Like other Dolls, they don't age, and don't truly die, they merely break, and can thus be “resurrected” through being repaired.

__Gearhearts draw Mana__ from the Ticking of their clock. Starting from the moment of their awakening as a witch a Clockwork will receive a medium charge of mana every hour on the hour like clockwork (this is relative to the passage of time for the Gearheart, stepping into an area of accelerated or slowed time would not charge the frequency of charging from the perspective of their perspective).

### Perk: Steam-powered
- Cost: 8

A steam-powered Gearheart benefits from a 150% boost to all their physical attributes, and may choose to gain any either fire, water, or air affinity. In emergency they may vent their steam in a scalding cloud, but in doing so will lose all benefits from this perk until their next hourly mana-charge. They are also now pleasantly warm to the touch, like a heating blanket.


## Race: Jabberwocky
- Elements: Shadows, Beast
- Mana capacity: Medium
- Mana rate: Low

Also called chaos dragons, Jabberwocky are seen as harbingers of chaos and disorder. Possessing the horns and tails of a dragon, and having patches of scales spread aesthetically across their bodies, Jabberwocky are highly resistant to non-magical attacks and possess a rather unique breath weapon: a Jabberwocky is capable of breathing out a soul-fire the colour of their aura that will inflict pain, madness, and disorientation, but no actual physical harm. These flames will cling to someone for anywhere from 5 seconds to five minutes, their duration being random each time, and their effects ceasing immediately once the flames run their course. This breath weapon can be used in either a 15ft cone, or a 30ft line. For every 10 years of life the range of this attack will increase unpredictably by anywhere from 3 to 7 feet. Jabberwocky age like Elves, and if killed without being decapitated their body will slowly repair itself, resurrecting when all the damage has been undone. This process can take, unpredictably, anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 days. A Jabberwocky draws mana: Chaotically.

__Jabberwockys draw Mana__ Randomly. Anywhere from 0 to 5 charges a day, spread randomly throughout the day, with each charge having an equal chance to be Low, Medium, or High (the Jabberwocky will be able to “feel” an oncoming charge of mana a minute or so before it occurs).

### Perk: …the Vorpal blade went snicker-snack…
- Cost: 8

You are now immune to non-magical weapons and attacks so long as they aren't immediately fatal (any harm inflicted by non-magical weapons will be immediately healed).


## Race: Obscura
- Elements: Mind, Shadows
- Mana capacity: Low
- Mana rate: Medium

An Obscura takes the form of a remarkably average human, possessing no features that stand out as unusual or noteworthy (a hybrid or chimera that's part Obscura will be similarly average in all their features). Not that it would particularly matter if they did have features that draw attention, as it's very difficult for any non-Obscura to remember details about an Obscura, with more powerful Obscura leaving ever fewer details to be remembered (for a weak Obscura you might have trouble remembering their eye-colour, name, or what clothing they wore. For an Obscura capable of R5 magic you would have difficulty recalling their voice, height, hair/skin colour, or even their sex/gender). An Obscura can, with a small amount of effort equivalent to a light jog, turn this ability off for a time. An Obscura ages at the same rate as a human would, but after reaching adulthood they will only age while under observation. Obscura can instantly resurrect to perfect health after dying, but only if no one witnessed their death. 

__Obscuras draw Mana__ from Obscurity. While unobserved an Obscura will continuously generate a low charge of mana. This is interrupted instantly as soon as they are seen by anyone or anything (remote surveillance only counts if it's being broadcast/monitored live).


## Race: Ornian
- Elements: Wind, Shadows
- Mana capacity: Medium
- Mana rate: Low

Ornians are a type of witch strongly associated with Owls, possessing large eyes, feathers in their hair, the ability to rotate their head 180 degrees (though they can still move their eyes normally), and will sometimes also have bird-like legs/talons. Just as an owl is a silent flyer, Ornians are themselves capable of moving very quietly, as well as casting magic without making any noise (though they would still need to mouth any required chants). Ornians age normally, reaching maturity at the same age as a human would, and living slightly longer on average. An Ornian is capable of creating “rebirth eggs”, magical shells that will capture the departed soul of its' maker, and over the course of the next 6 months will grow them a new body (the new body will either be the witch's previous age or that of a young adult, whichever is younger). It takes a day of meditation and effort to conjure a rebirth egg.

__Ornians draw Mana__ from Regularity. When an Ornian sticks to routines and patterns for longer than 3 days they benefit from a constant low charge.

### Perk: Blessed of Athena
- Cost: 5

Not a literal divine blessing, the Blessed of Athena are Ornians who possess a set of magically retractile wings which gives them the ability to fly (50MPH, benefits from and contributes to other flight-speed bonuses). In addition, these Ornians are capable of having up to 5 rebirth eggs at once, allowing them to have backups in case one is damaged or destroyed.
