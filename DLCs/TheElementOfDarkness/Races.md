# The Element of Darkness

## Race: Nightgaunt
- Elements: Shadows, Soul
- Mana capacity: High
- Mana rate: Low

Nightgaunts are beings of elemental darkness who take on the shape of another
species of witch (though none of their abilities, unless you're a hybrid/chimera of that species). A Nightgaunt casts a particularly dark shadow, regardless of light-level. If cut, a Nightgaunt will bleed Shade-Blood, a viscous liquid shadow that dissipates under light (this is a somewhat valuable R3 alchemical reagent). While hidden in shadows a Nightgaunt becomes partially melded with them, making physical attacks against them less effective, and slowly healing them of any wounds. A Nightgaunt ages like a human, but while in darkness they will age in reverse at twice their normal rate of aging (this wont work before they're adults, and won't bring them back to pre-adulthood). If slain a Nightgaunt can be brought back to life by placing them in perfect darkness, after which their body will heal and they will re-awaken. Beware however, once dead light will cause a Nightgaunt's body to begin to disintegrate, so get them somewhere dark quickly.

__Nightgaunts draw Mana__ from Darkness. While in light-levels too low for an ordinary human to see in a Nightgaunt will continuously generate a Low charge of mana. If in absolute darkness with no visible light whatsoever this will increase to a Medium charge.

### Perk
- Cost: 4

A Nightgaunt with their species perk casts an extremely dark shadow regardless
of what sources of light there are. This shadow can be controlled by the Nightgaunt, and is capable of separating from its host. A Nightgaunt controlling their shadow can see and hear whatever is going on around the shadow (though they can't see colour), and is capable of casting magic through it as though it were a familiar. When a Nightgaunt stops controlling this shadow it will dissolve and reappear attached once more to its host.


## Race: Amazon Dryad
- Elements: Nature, Shadows
- Mana capacity: Medium
- Mana rate: Low

Putting the Venus in Venus-flytrap, Amazon-Dryads are a carnivorous Dryad
subspecies that enjoy a symbiotic relationship with carnivorous plants of all kinds. This subspecies often has leaves and twigs like a regular Dryad, but will also sometimes have Flesh-eating plants like Venus Flytraps and Pitcher Plants incorporated into their anatomy. Amazon-Dryads are capable of rooting themselves in place, growing an interconnected garden of carnivorous plants from their roots. Whenever the Amazon-Dryad roots themselves after growing a garden they can choose to either magically transport their existing garden to their current location, or to grow a new garden (in which case the old garden becomes a purely mundane collection of plants). A garden starts out at a few meters across, but may, over time, grow up to an acre in size. An Amazon-Dryad ages normally, but when rooted will de-age at 10x the speed they normally age. When slain they will begin to regrow withing a pod under the roots of their garden, reaching the equivalent of an 8 year old human after 3 months, and regaining their memories throughout the following week.

__Amazon-Dryads draw Mana__ from Nutrition. Whenever a plant in their garden catches prey they will receive a low charge of mana. An Amazon-Dryad may bring an animal carcass to feed their garden (the body will be dragged below by the roots, and its nutrients will be absorbed swiftly) they will instead receive a continuous medium charge of mana instead. This medium charge will last until the garden finishes getting all the nutrients out of the body, and as such, larger animals will last longer (a human body would last roughly 24 hours on average, for reference).

### Perk
- Cost: 4

With this perk an Amazon-Dryad may incorporate any plant they have
previously come into contact with into their garden, not just carnivorous ones. Magical plants will take longer to grow, proportional to how potent their magic is.
