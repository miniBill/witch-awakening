# The Element of Darkness

## Race: Nightgaunt
- Elements: Shadows, Soul
- Mana capacity: High
- Mana rate: Low

Nightgaunts are beings of elemental darkness who take on the shape of another
species of witch (though none of their abilities, unless you're a hybrid/chimera of that species). A Nightgaunt casts a particularly dark shadow, regardless of light-level. If cut, a Nightgaunt will bleed Shade-Blood, a viscous liquid shadow that dissipates under light (this is a somewhat valuable R3 alchemical reagent). While hidden in shadows a Nightgaunt becomes partially melded with them, making physical attacks against them less effective, and slowly healing them of any wounds. A Nightgaunt ages like a human, but while in darkness they will age in reverse at twice their normal rate of aging (this wont work before they're adults, and won't bring them back to pre-adulthood). If slain a Nightgaunt can be brought back to life by placing them in perfect darkness, after which their body will heal and they will re-awaken. Beware however, once dead light will cause a Nightgaunt's body to begin to disintegrate, so get them somewhere dark quickly.

__Nightgaunts draw Mana__ from darkness. While in light-levels too low for an ordinary human to see in a Nightgaunt will continuously generate a Low charge of mana. If in absolute darkness with no visible light whatsoever this will increase to a Medium charge.

### Perk
- Cost: 4

A Nightgaunt with their species perk casts an extremely dark shadow regardless
of what sources of light there are. This shadow can be controlled by the Nightgaunt, and is capable of separating from its host. A Nightgaunt controlling their shadow can see and hear whatever is going on around the shadow (though they can't see colour), and is capable of casting magic through it as though it were a familiar. When a Nightgaunt stops controlling this shadow it will dissolve and reappear attached once more to its host.
