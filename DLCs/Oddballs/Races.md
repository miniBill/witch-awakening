## Race: Hekatonkheire
- Elements: Body, Metal
- Mana capacity: High
- Mana rate: Medium

A Hekatonkheire appears mostly human at first glance, but this is an illusion created by many finely jointed arms tucked and folded into place. They find it intuitive to move and speak as a human would, but can also briefly unfold an arm from an unexpected location, or unfurl themselves fully to reveal the knot of arms they truly are. They grow new arms at a rate of about one per year at alternating shoulder joints, but will always heal and regenerate damaged arms before growing new ones. If a Hekatonkheire's body is fully destroyed, they will regrow one arm at a time from their clearest and most detailed handprint, usually taking a few decades to recover the ability to speak, and a few more to fully restore their human appearance; if no clear handprints are available, they cannot return to life.

__Hekatonkheires draw Mana__ from Handiwork, the physical effort expended by their body, especially at any practical or skillful task. The Medium charge rate represents skilled crafts or acrobatics; rote movements like pushups or weightlifting will only charge Low.

### Perk
- Cost: 3

You can freely shapeshift your arms and hands to any structurally congruent form, including flippers, hooves, and wings - though you'll need some practice to learn how to use them. This shapeshifting also lets you reconfigure your body, altering minor details of your appearance and easily changing the number of visible arms you manifest and where they show up. You also grow new arms twice as fast.


## Race: Amalgam
- Elements: !
- Mana capacity: High
- Mana rate: High

An Amalgam begins as a seamless synergistic synthesis of two other races. Their appearance and abilities are a mix of the two that enhances and exaggerates notable features from both. They have one Element from one component race and a different one from the other.

If an Amalgam dies and none of their component races have an immortality method that is able to revive them, they can revive using the immortality method of any other race, gaining that race in the process (but not its charge method). Rumour has it that new races can be created this way, but it's hard to be sure.

__Amalgams draw Mana__ from Conjunction: when using both component races' charge methods at once, they charge much faster. An Amalgam using two Medium or faster charge methods can "overflow" and begin to regenerate other things like wakefulness, nutrition, youth, and even potentially lost limbs.

### Perk
- Cost: 6
You gain the charge methods of races you revive with. Overflow is virtually guaranteed if you use three or more at once, regardless of how slow they are. 

Also, if you have Apex, it applies to race features gained through revival, which it otherwise would not.
