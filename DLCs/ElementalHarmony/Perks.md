# Elemental Harmony

## Perk: Fog Sight
- Element: Water
- Class: Warlock
- Cost: 6

You can see through fog, clouds, rain, and other precipitation (though not smoke or ash) at least as well as in clear air. Other senses also improve to the best that any ambient water could make them, e.g. the sound of rain doesn’t distract your ears and you can hear over long distances like the world was blanketed with snow.


## Perk: Stasis
- Element: Necro
- Class: Academic
- Cost: 3

You can prevent material from rotting. This requires renewal every few days, taking a minute for something the size of a corpse or a backpack’s worth of food, or can be made automatic for a Witchery 3+ pocket dimension or Dominion 2+ reality bubble.


## Perk: Skimmer Dancing
- Element: Water
- Class: Sorceress
- Cost: 3

You can walk and run across the surface of water or other liquids as if they were solid, even if it’s very choppy. You can run up a waterfall, though it will be a little slow. This even extends to lava and similar, though it doesn’t protect you from the heat or other dangers.


## Perk: Wind Whisperer
- Element: Wind
- Class: Warlock
- Cost: 6

You can hear anything the wind could theoretically bring to your ears. The longer the distance, the more time it will take to focus in; mana can speed this up but only to a point, if you want to hear half the world away it will take a day without mana and an hour if you dump a full High pool into it. You need to know what, or who, you’re listening for, or you’ll get a confusing random sample from an area.


## Perk: Depth Search
- Element: Water
- Class: Sorceress
- Cost: 8

You have a sonar sense for any body of water you’re in contact with. You have a passive tactile map of a 10m radius (or your maximum Waterworking range if higher), can extend that 10x with concentration, and can get an imprecise picture out to 100x your passive range.


## Perk: Absolute Zero Momentum
- Element: Water
- Class: Academic
- Cost: 8

You can harness the power of cold to completely arrest the momentum of objects. Affecting spells costs mana, somewhat less than it takes to cast them but scaling with power. Spells without a physical component (e.g. Curses, Psychotics) are unaffected.


## Perk: Diggy Diggy Hole
- Element: Earth
- Class: Sorceress
- Cost: 4

You can tunnel through earth or stone, traveling at a slow walking pace. You can hold your breath roughly ten times as long as normal while you do. Through loose earth, you can leave an open tunnel behind you that others can use; through stone, you cannot unless you also have Earthmoving 3+.


## Perk: Aspicio Mori
- Element: Necro
- Class: Academic
- Cost: 16

Looking closely at a living being, you can see the most efficient way you could kill it using the capabilities you have available. This is slower and harder to see if they are protected by active magical effects, and does not take into account allies, spells that they may cast or have cast on them, or magic which is within your theoretical but unrealized capabilities, though it does include race traits and all perks.


## Perk: Bloodline
- Element: Blood
- Class: Sorceress
- Cost: 4

Must not be a bloodless race. You can tell how closely related two individuals are at a glance, unless their race is bloodless, i.e. has neither blood nor a reasonable facsimile of it.

A new person who is related to a previous acquaintance will probably feel familiar in a way you can’t quite place.

If personally procreating, or present to assist with others who are, you can manipulate their blood to pick a possible outcome within the racial mix that would otherwise be possible, e.g. ensuring a Mimi+/Elf+ couple produce a Mimi/Elf hybrid with the Elf perk but not the Mimi one.


## Perk: Technopath
- Element: Metal
- Class: Academic
- Cost: 10

Your magic moves easily through computer networks and electronic systems, and spells to allow your senses to do the same come naturally to you, in whatever medium you try. Convey mental effects through a text forum, destructive ones through a building’s wiring, etc. Note: High risk of masquerade violations.


## Perk: Beacon Gates
- Element: Fire
- Class: Warlock
- Cost: 9

You can use fires you’ve lit, or existing fires you know well (e.g. your parent’s fireplace), as gateways; you can look or speak through them, reach a hand through, or for a large enough fire walk or fly through bodily. You’re limited by size of the flame on both ends, and magic, even firecalling, will be very difficult to aim and control unless your head and hands are on the side where the magic is aimed. Range is limited but can be slowly improved for one endpoint by reusing it frequently for a long time.
