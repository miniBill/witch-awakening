- Slot: Folk
- Threat: 2
- Conflict: 2
- Reward: 2

Want to know the best way to bond with your familiar and meet new witches? Familiar playdates! Bring all your companions along to make a party at your house, or even better, another's! With this party, you can get to know your companions better, along with your new partner. Mishaps aplenty to boot! Maybe you need to break up a fight between a cat and an owl. Perhaps you will play a deception game, letting you know your friends better. Maybe go out on the town, and paint it red? 'What ever you do, just make sure to have some fun! I've got too many stuffy, stuck-up witches to deal with. You'll probably make a deeper bond with your familiar as well.

Notes:
+ You should make a better bond with your familiar, or&nbsp;soon&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;one
+ A better bond means better efficiency, aka it takes less out of you while still the familiar still grows stronger
- Something bad may happen, maybe a smashed mirror here or there, or being on the wrong side of some gnomes
