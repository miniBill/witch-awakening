## Relic: Cursed Cards
- Cost: 18

While I was traveling, I luckily picked up these nifty things as a souvenir from some evil god, or maybe it was a devil god?

Anyways, these cards are quite tricky, as they will force the loser of any games played with them to obey any 1 thing the winner says, covenants in card form if you will, though I think it works as a curse. The players don't even need to be aware of this. I was told that it is best to set a time limit, as the command will not stop otherwise. I was also told that the effect is really powerful, so much that most of the gods around here could not resist the magic, much less break it. I was on my way to test a set myself. I got two.
